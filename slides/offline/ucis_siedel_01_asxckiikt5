# Is this a position-based or interest-based negotiation? 

VVVVV
## Pizza case

- Do you like everything 
- Or are you just addicted to cheese

<aside class="notes">

Position based negotiation are negotiation quite binary: <br>
We both want a pizza<br>
Iether I get more or the pizza or you get more of the pizza <br>
The focus of the negotiation is the size/amount<br><br>

We might wanna go toward an interest-based negotiation<br> 
in which cas i m going to be interested in the underlying interests<br><br>

Crust vs cheeze

# Am I trying to resolve a dispute or make a deal? 

VVVVV
## Distinction

- Deal Making
 - Forward looking
 - focus on the interests of the parties
 - Problem Solving

- Dispute Resolution
 - Backward looking
 - more positional
 - Adversarial

<aside class="notes">
However in dispute still think about interests of both parties<br>
Eg. example :<br> intellectual property dispute between software company and lycensee <br>
<br>opportunity for a join venture that suits both sides

</aside>

VVVVV
## Dispute Resolution: 6 processes

- Avoidance
- Negotiation 
- Mediation 
- Arbitration 
- Litigation 
- Power 

<aside class="notes">
1 giving up | i let u have it<br>
2 buisness<br>
3 buisness third party <br>
4 private litigation third party take the decision<br>
5 litigation => law<br>
6 power => force<br><br>

example: 2 line for basketball tickets<br>
1 4am 1 7am two different places<br>
who is right?<br><br>

police said l1 back l2 - arbitration<br><br>
reponsible came up with additional tickets - mediaton (trying to satisfy both side)<br><br>

# How Should I Analyze a Negotiation? 

VVVVV
## Framework to consider the given response

- What is your overall goal in reaching a negotiated agreement?
- What issues are most important to you in reaching this goal? Why are these issues important?
- What is your Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement (BATNA)?
- What is your reservation price (often the lowest price that you will accept)?
- What is your most likely price?
- What is your stretch goal?

<aside class="notes">
need to assess if the offer fills our needs <br> as well as how interesting it is 

overall results of people using large strectch goal are better<br>
but credibility! not so large that credibility is lost<br><br>

batna for deal making!

- You are preparing to negotiate the sale of your car to a possible buyer, Pooja.  She is the only person who responded to an ad that you posted one week ago.
- You need at least 4000 from the sale to ﬁnance the purchase of a truck that you have ordered.  You want to keep your car for three more weeks, which is when the truck will arrive. 
- The reasonable value of the car is 5000 (based on several online calculators). 
- If you can’t ﬁnd a buyer willing to pay at least 4500, you will sell the to a friend, Tommaso, for 4000.  You know that Tommaso will let you keep the car for the next three weeks.

<aside class="notes">
Exemple from the videos<br><br>
think sell car to Pooja<br>
<br> 4000 to buy a truck <br><br>
 keep car 3 weeks untiltruck arrive <br><br>
 reasonable price is 5000<br><br>
 we already have an offer of a friend for 4000

now we need to evaluate her Batna

give us ZOPA

2 possibility<br>
1: not important but use it to get a lower price<br><br>

2: she needs it immediately<br>

if she demands car immediately and we demand it in three weeks -> **we each have a position**  <br>
**look interest driven**<br> maybe she needs the car to get to work, give her ride to work

## BATNA for a dispute resolution

<aside class="notes">
probably litigation or arbitration

## deepens on the litigation system

basic elements in the litigation process."

- _The Belgian Judicial Code expressly recognises the "loser pays" principle, under which the unsuccessful party must cover the costs of the proceedings. Therefore, court costs are usually borne by the unsuccessful party._

Punitive damages doesn't exists in Belgium.
Punitive damages: malicious, intentional injury -> criminal fine that goes to the victim

## Completing BATNA analysis with decision trees 
![](https://framapic.org/KvxrP8k4HnAe/MHR4nEk4shl5.PNG)

<aside class="notes">
Your company has sued a supplier for 4.6 million. There is a 50-50 chance that your company will win. Future legal and other expenses to litigate the case total 400,000.  
During negotiations, the defendant has offered to settle the case for 2 million. Should your company accept the offer?


Decision trees are valuable tools for analyzing your BATNA in both dispute resolution and deal- making negotiations. <br>
This tool is also useful in making other complex business decisions (eg you want to buy a company of the same price, one more valuable but one can be chalenge by the governement and might win -> if u know the % you can make a savy choice)

# cross-cultural negotiation

VVVVV 
# cross-cultural negotiation
- Should we act like the other side?
 - What if both sides try to adapt?
 - What if we don't understand it fully?

<aside class="notes">
don't try to act like the other side (__surface culture__)<br><br>
problem if both try to adapt (japanese hug men and american bowing)<br><br>
risk of stereotypical if not fully understand<br><br>
eg. left hand is the toilet hand<br><br>

stay own style but respect

# How Should I Handle Ethical Issues? 

VVVVV 

# Two types of ethical issues

- Law-Based Ethical Standards
- General Ethical Standards
 
<aside class="notes">
we talk about the overlap of the two<br>
- example law of england ride left side of raw (people not un ethical)<br>
- "one should not kill" is both general and law base
</aside>

VVVVV 

## Three main law base ethical standard for negotiation

- Fraud: False representation of a material fact that is relied on by the other side
- Fiduciary Duty: A high duty of trust and loyalty
- Unconscionability: Violates principles of good conscience
 - Procedural: absence of choice
 - Substantive: unreasonable terms

<aside class="notes">
common tactic while negotiating<br>
everyone should know that people can change their price despite saying other wise, process of negotiation<br><br>

on behalf of company buy secretely land with minerals without disclosing it<br> later secretly buy more stock from another share holder<br>when disclosed price double<br><br>

Unconscionability:
Company (hooters) said employees to sign a document to not go to court but to go to adr <br>
Employees must provide notice of claims, not Hooters.<br>
Hooters selects arbitration panel.<br>
Hooters may record hearing, not employees.<br>
Hooters may cancel agreement to arbitrate, not employees.<br>
Hooters may change rules at any time.

</aside>

VVVVV 

## General ethical standard for negotiation

- Organizational Standards
- Mentor: Someone you admire
- Personal Standards

<aside class="notes">
- The Chicago Tylenol Murders <br>
cyanide - call back - great lost- protective packaging<br><br>
- company accidentaly sending it s negotiation strategy, boss don't want to hear it <br><br>

#  Should I use an agent to negotiate for me?

VVVVV 

##  Should I use an agent to negotiate for me?

- Is the agent a better negotiator?
- Does the agent have more experience in negotiating the issues (for example, a sports agent)
- Does the negotiation involve a technical matter that requires the expertise of an agent (for example, a complex legal matter)?
- How much time do I have to invest in a negotiation?
- What is my relationship with the other side?
