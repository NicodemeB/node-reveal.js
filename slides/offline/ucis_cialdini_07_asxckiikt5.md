# Influence - Chapter  7: Scarcity

VVVVV
## Structure 

- A word on microeconomic principles
- Introduction to the effect of scarcity
- Reactance 
- Optimal conditions
- How to say no

Notes:
  - like in the book we will see examples that allow find the  key parts of the concept one by one to work our way toward the big picture
  - We will observe scarcity
  - we will fully understand the mechanism behind  scarcity after we have seen the reactance

  One conclusion for the two first part and a break

# A word on microeconomic principles

VVVVV

### 7 principles

- Introduction to the effect of scarcity
	- Commodity Theory
	- Liberalization of Commodity Theory
	- Energization Theory of Motivation
- Reactance 
	- Reactance Theory
	- Frustration Theory
- Optimal conditions
	- Bandwagon, Snob, and Veblen Effects
	- Need for Uniqueness Theory

Notes:

- It was suggested last week | seems interresting 
- I've never had such course <- one is on coursera (don't know if those principle are in it)
- A very brief introduction to the 7 principles at the end of each concept (found in a dissertation)

# Introduction to scarcity

VVVVV
## Introduction to scarcity

- The mormon temple
- Unknown caller


Notes:

- temple renovated, article saying forbidden part of temple accessible for a few day
  - call a friend to go with him
  - realize while calling that he doesn't care
  
- doesn't matter the quality of the irl conversation
  - the call could be missed forever 


VVVVV
## Intuition and first key concept

We are more motivated by the fear of missing something than by the chance of winning something 

Notes:
- intuition

- concept that will help explaining scarcity effect

- we will see more examples later on

Transition:  negotiation by seidel: 02.6 Psychological Tool: Framing


VVVVV
## Siedel: Framing 

Can that knowledge be used in negotiation?

- When faced with a positive choice, we tend to be risk-averse.
- When we're faced with a negative choice, we tend to be risk seeking.

Notes:
- previous paraphrase= fear make us take more risks 

- Same principle | different way to see it

- example of the book: 
 - show soemone the cost of not changing inapropriate isolation more chance of him changing it than showing the benefice

- key concept to explain scarcity effect
- The video is the 02.6 Psychological Tool: Framing



VVVVV

## Example

- Precious mistake effect
- The IT store


Notes:
/!\ Now let's go back to some example of scarcity 

- precious mistake:
postamp or bills with defects worth much more despite being of a lesser quality just because of scarcity </br>
 side note: google only find stuff about unwanted babies</br>

- Pushing to the maximum : not available
Sadly this one is already sold  - client ask if in reserve
I'll look in reserve but so you confirm that this is the one you want if I find it at the same price
Come back with article and contract



VVVVV

## Example: OnePlus

![](https://framapic.org/aSq94AfnPcFt/GBkoWn3kBCuI.PNG)

Notes:
Number produced or shipped i europe was limited (smth like that) </br></br>
You have to register to "get a chance" of buying it </br> scarcity ! competition!  and even delay!</br></br>

I had felt stupid to have missed the oportunity to buy it by missing that email</br>

While I actually knew nothing about the phone, just heard about it while looking for one
One teacher had it and students were impressed/curious

Affect my view of the brand until today even though i'm clueless


VVVVV

## More example: The delay effect

- The mormon temple
- Offer over a car only available immediately
- Steam sales 

Notes:
-car dealership</br>
- Steam sales: outside the book examples</br></br>

-goal is to not let the time for the user to analyse the situation and make him believe that the opportunity will be lost forever


VVVVV

## "The thing of the machine rooms"

- Three steps/calls
 - Phonecall of introduction
 - Big profits are to be made but it's no longer possible to invest
 - Investissement is possible but have to be immediate

Notes:
companies that have dozens of employees on the phone calling thousands of clients
and scam millions of dollars

Call 1
they use an adress on wall street, have a name that inspire confidence
they ask if the client accep to receive their advertiselent

Call 2

Call 3

page 334-335



VVVVV

## What we learned

- Rare things are things we will never have a second chance to possess
- We are more motivated by the fear of missing something than by the chance of winning something 
- Delays
- Conclusion: we hate seeing our range possibilities reduced


Notes:
Delays prevent us from :</br>
 - analysing the situation while putting us </br>
 - under the impression that the oppotunity will not present itself again</br></br>

speaking of liberty being reduced, we will now talk about reactance</br></br>

- In other words: our liberty reduced</br></br>

when something becomes rare or that something prevent us from having it we react in oposition to those forces  and we want it more

VVVVV

## Microeconomics

- Commodity Theory
  - anything useful
  - conveyable between two person
  - possessable
  - valued to the extent of unavailability
  
- Liberalization of Commodity Theory
  -  personal traits and skills
  
Notes:
    
Commodity Theory : 

A commodity is anything that is useful to its possessor, conveyable from one person to another, and potentially possessable. 

"any commodity will be valued to the extent it is unavailable" (Brock, 1968, p. 246). 
The manners by which a commodity may become unavailable are delay, cost/effort, scarcity, restrictions and other reasons. 

Liberalization of Commodity Theory:
extended to include personal traits and skills (which are by nature not conveyable from one person to another) and commodities that are not useful to its possessor
  
VVVVV

## Microeconomics
  
- Energization Theory of Motivation

  - effort determined by difficulty
  
  - less available = harder to get = more effort

Notes:

Energization Theory of Motivation:
readiness to exert additional effort is directly determined by the perceived difficulty of a task; as perceived difficulty increases, so does effort unless a task is perceived as unsolvable
=> the less available a commodity is, the harder it is to get, the more efforts we are ready to make



>>>>> 

# Reactance

VVVVV

## Reactance: theory

- Jack Brehm
- liberty of choice and associated goods restricted
- we value it/them more


Notes:
Each time our liberty of choice is threaten or restricted
we suddenly accord it more value 
and we value the goods associated with it more

page 337


 
VVVVV

## Reactance: The two years old children example

- Virginia University study
 - 2 toys equally desirable
   - one behind plexiglas
   - one in front of the child
 - plexiglas iether tall or short enough for the child to grab the object behind 
   - Both accessible, no difference
   - One not accessible, children went directly for it

Notes:
opposition crisis
they resist everything, 
you tell them to do something, they do the opposite

24 months
plexiglas: 30 or 60 cm
first case: child can pass his hand over the glass
second case: child has to walk around

the object was touch by children 3x faster than the object readily availble


p 338 - 339




VVVVV

## Why does it happen at that age?

- The child gains consciousness of his individuality
- What about adolescents?


Notes:
- 2 years old

- before extension of his social environement

- an independent being - can make choice
- liberty - look for informations about the limits


- giving up dependency towards the parents 
- reactance: enforcing traditional authority makes it worse 
- (kinda boomerang effect)
- example Romeo & Juliette



VVVVV

## Roméo & Juliette 

- Summary in a nutshell
 - Families want to prevent the love of the two adolescents
 - Double suicide 
- What if that love was strengthened by the parents' opposition?
 - Study of 140 couples in Colorado

Notes:
- We can ask ourselves if that love, left alone would have faded away like all juvenile love

- Study: love and desire of marriage is bigger when there i an opposition
 but couple are more critical of each other 
      
  testimony page 371


VVVVV

## Adverisement example

"Women have come a long way since the social pressure prevented them to smoke"

Notes: 

- reactance against social pressure  - perceived opposition 
- the only demographic who start to smoke more was the adolescents
 
- Transition: Were the smoke better percieved? Let's see if restriction has an impact on perception with next example
 
- For more example: Kennesaw gun law example pg 342, 343


VVVVV

## Perception of the object of the restriction

- Regulation anti phosphate in Miami's county 
 - laundry product containing it are forbidden
 - smuggling of laundry product 
 - piling up large stock 
 - County's inhabitant start to have a better opinion of the products that inhabitants of a neighbour county

Notes:

 - when liberty is restricted (rare item) our desire increase
 - we don't know it's due to reactance
 - but we know we desire the product
 - so we justify it to ourself
 - if i want the product, it must mean it has a lot of qualities
  
  let's observe this with an experiment


VVVVV

## Purdue University Experiment

- Two version of an advertisement for a novel
  - With age restriction (21 yo)
  - Without
- Novel with age restriction
  - More desired
  - Reader think more willingly that the book will please him
  

Notes:
read last

  - This one done on young adult</br>
  - That effect is more worrying with adolescents</br></br>

Transition: 
 - Not cool
 - Could explain things like drug perception
 - Can it get worst?
 - What about restriction on something else than a product?
 - What about censorship?


VVVVV

## Effect of restrictions on informations

- North Carolina University
- Speach against mixity in universties was banned
- Students became more opposed to that idea

Notes:
- people tend to have a more favorable opinion on a thesis 
    without hearing the arguments
        
- unpopular positions could forward their cause by
    making arrangements to be censored 
                
- this is a strong argument in favor of freedom of speach 
        
- Transition: Are only governemental restrictions considered as censorship?


VVVVV

## Many sources of perceived censorship

- Chicago university experiment
- Woman hit by a car, driver guilty
- Amount of damage due by the driver 
 - $33000 in average if insurance is not disclosed
 - $37000 if jury knows driver is insured
 - $46000 if the information is declared inadmissible

Notes:
Read first
</br>
- Judges can declare facts as inadmissible</br>
- the information is not prohibited (already provided)</br>
- Use of the information by the jury is forbidden</br>
- this can be perceived as Censorship</br>

- real jury took after real trial, were presented with a fake one & deliberated on it like they would have before </br>

- we see once again that more value is given to the information if it's subject to censorship/restrictions</br>

- scarcity and censorship can be combined for more effectiveness: </br>
 - beef importer told his clients  a shortage of the product and  information  not public </br>
 - his stocks were emptied 


VVVVV

## Conclusion of scarcity and reactance

 scarcity is a shortcut 
- fear of missing something gives motivation
- delay effect
- scarcity effect can be explained by the reactance effect 
- we cannot stand to see a restriction on our liberty

Notes:

VVVVV

## Microeconomics

- Reactance Theory
  - "Forbidden fruit must be good"
- Frustration Theory
  - "I'm sure the fruit is sour anyway"
- Opposition?
  - choice offered and then removed
  - choice unavailable from the start


Notes:

Reactance Theory:
when a freedom is eliminated or threatened, people will evaluate the freedom more positively and will react in a way to maintain it 
"forbidden fruit must be good"

Frustration Theory:
A person expects a reward towards which he or she has been conditioned, the absence of the reward will create primary frustration response
in which case he devaluate the product

"i'm sure the forbidden fruit is sour anyway"

Versus :
WORCHEL (1975) reactance and VERHALLEN (1982) frustration (devaluation of the product unavailable)
a choice alternative is first offered and subsequently removed (made unavailable or threatened to be made unavailable) a reactance effect occurs and the alternative increases in value
an attractive choice alternative is offered as unavailable or blocked from the beginning, a frustration effect might be hypothesized, and the alternative decreases in value


Break now?


>>>>>

# Optimal conditions

VVVVV

## Worchel's experiment

- How tasty are those biscuits?
 - More tasty if there are 2 rather than 10
- Presented with a box of 10, replaced by a box of 2
 - More value perceived (from 51 cents to 61)
- Two types of excuse to replace the box
 - Reduced because of a mistake
 - Reduced because the biscuits are needed due to the demand


Notes:
- By now this doesn't come as a surprise 

- see the abundance of the ressource is reduced 

- If it's because of the demand, highest level of appreciation
        due to competition for limited ressources
        eg. advertisement where shopper compete to get the item
        black friday
        + fish example pg 361
                + auction sale (example pg 363)


VVVVV

##  Competition

- throwing vast amount of food to a shoal of fish -> no need for bait
- black friday
- ABC pays 3.3 millions for movie right

Notes:
- fisherman no need to waist bait
- fish grab everything even just cords </br></br>
- auction sale: highest for right to show a movie on tv
- 1 million lost
- first time movie offered trhough an auction
- competition

Transition: case of reactions following an abundance of ressources that suddenly becomes scarce



VVVVV

## James C. Davies theroy

 _"Revolutions are most likely to occur when a prolonged period of objective economic and social development is followed by a short period of sharp reversal"_
 

Notes:
     better conditions = more liberties => worst = restriction 
  
  pg 354 american 60 racial tensions



VVVVV

## URSS rebellion 

- Gorbatchev started giving more rights
- KGB, governement members 
- Massive spontaneous revolution
- Gave up in favor of Gorbatchev </br>

- If you are a dictator, don't give anything you might want back

Notes:

- KGB, military; governement officials for old regime

- expected that nothing would happen

- population considered docile

- won't let go what they are given

pg 356 URSS revolution

VVVVV

## Microeconomics

- Bandwagon effect
  - chapter 4: social proof principle
  - reverse when threat to identity
- Snob effect
- Veblen effect
  - price instead of consumption 
  - Part about trapping in chapter 6
- Need for Uniqueness Theory

Notes:

Bandwagon, Snob, and Veblen Effects:

Bandwagon effect: "extent to which the demand for a commodity is increased due to the fact that others are also consuming the same commodity" (Leibenstein, 1950, p. 189)
-> social proof principle chapter 4
-> reversed when consumers evaluate the popularity of a product as a threat to their identity
snob effect: "extent to which the demand for a consumers` good is decreased owning to the fact that others are also consuming the same commodity" (Leibenstein, 1950, p. 189)
The Veblen effect: "extent to which the demand for a consumers` good is increased because it bears a higher rather than a lower price"(Leibenstein, 1950, p. 189)
like snob effect but based on price and not consumption
-> trapping cialdini 6

# How to say no? 

VVVVV

## How to say no?

- The peasure doesn't come from using the rare object but to  own it
- Why do we want it?
 - Psychological advantages
 - Usability

Notes:
- if it is usability then we need to remember that things that are rare are not more enjoyable to use that their counterparts

example of his brother selling cars pg 367



>>>>>

# Conclusion

- Scarcity
- Delay
- Reactance
- Views on the target of an interdiction
- Censorship (not only governmental -> judiciary system
- Stronger when we see the reource get scarcer
- Competition
- Why do we want it? To do what?

Notes: 
    - Excerpt from the medium article by Vishal
    - Diamonds have always been thought of as a rare item that could only be found in a few places around the world through labor-intensive mining. However, the reality is that diamonds are far more common that the public has been led to believe, as large gem companies have created artificial scarcity by controlling the supply of diamonds that enter the market. The practice started in the 1880’s, when Cecil Rhodes, the chairman of De Beers mining company discovered that he could inflate prices on command by taking control of the rights to every diamond mine he could find. According to the Washington Post, this subsequently led to De Beers owning “90 percent of the world’s rough-diamond trade through most of the 20th century, as the company hoarded stones in basement vaults and doled them out strategically.”
Although De Beers’ share of the diamond market has decreased to 40%, this tactic is still practiced today, now with other companies like Alrosa and Argyle with holding a certain amount of the 163 million carats mined annually from the marketplace.

- Quoted: 
    "Brands can use the scarcity principle to persuade people to fill out a lead form, purchase a product, or take another desired action. Here’s an example: On many air travel booking sites, such as KAYAK, flight listings are displayed with a note that only a few seats are left at a certain price."  source: https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/the-scarcity-principle (last accessed time 2019, 05 12)

    - Long story making short
    - Old publication with some complex statistic
    - Trying to make it as simple as possible

 ### Test result (not so intuitive)

Notes:
    - With respect to the second hypothesis, on the effect of the social
condition on the uniqueness and cost evaluation, Figs. la and lb show that
the books of limited availability were evaluated as more unique in the
nonconstraining condition than in the constraining condition (LMC = 2.15
versus 2.49, p < 0.01).

- Overall, the first and second hypotheses received support with regard to
the uniqueness and cost evaluation data. A book of limited availability due
to a market cause was evaluated as more costly and more nearly unique
than an alternative of unlimited availability.
