# Intro to Design: 5 questions to start thinking about design 

Notes:
Section based on the interview of 3 Dr:

- Tammy Clegg
- Mona Leigh Guha 
- Allison Druin


Section kind of **vague**
VVVVV
Overview of the questions guiding us:
- Question 1: ...
- Question 2: ...

VVVVV
## Question 1 

What is Design ?

- Different ways to look at design 
    - Visual look <-> Perception
    - Functionality <-> Interaction, usage   





VVVVV
## Question 2

How does the design process work and how does it improve usability ?


"*our design process, comes out of the philosophy that if you're going to design* **for children** *you design* **with children** *.*"

**Users are included all along**

Notes:
- **SUPER VAGUE ANSWER**
- include children in **every steps**, from **brainstorm** to iterative **testing**
- Should be transfered for every population; is you work with bankers, includes bankers, 
- If we are developing **for dogs**, we probably want to have dogs with us because **we are not dogs**
- We have to have a population working with us
- This will result in a **better product**


VVVVV

### Source 

- 1970s
- Scandinavian countries,
- Social Democratic Movement

Notes:
- The idea came from the 1970s (Scandinavian countries, From the Social Democratic Movement), when factory workers asked computer scientists how they were going to develop computer system that are used by the factory workers
- Better integration by the 1990s → still applied today

VVVVV

## Types of design approaches

VVVVV

### Informant Design

- User at the start of the design process (interviews/observation),
- User goes away during the design,
- User bring back to test

Notes:
- User needed at the beginning where we must be informed (**Observation / interviews**)
- Computer Scientist then develop 
- Bring the user back to test what was developed
- Repeat 


VVVVV

### Participatory Design 

- With children : most used design process

Notes:
    - ?: Pros/Cons?
    - Same with users? (because the point is that they are different than us, same goes for the users. They understand and use technology differently than us)

VVVVV

### Persona Design

- Start by observing the target population
- Make profiles of these population
- Used in military

Notes:
Example : Jackie : 12 yo; likes play sports 

- not as rich as if you work with the population
    - """not as **wonderful** as if you work with **children**"""
- **Military** : done because of the clearance level



VVVVV
## Question 3

What is the best way to incorporate design methodology into our work ?

- Where are we in the design process
    - idea decided : just iterate on that 
- Money/time/people
- Goal
    - Make product better 
    - Create a theory
    - ?

Notes:
Depends on where are we in the design process:

- if the **idea is already decided** : we have to iterate on that
- also depends on the **time, money and people we have**
- goal : 
    - theory : generalizable and scientific ways of understanding what users are doing
        - may end up testing with thousands of people to make sure that this thing is bulletproof
    - tech : may be a different approach



VVVVV
## Question 4

What if you're just some guy building an app in your basement with limited resources? What's the best way to do design methods ?

- **Think** about to whom the app is addressed, **talk** to these people,
    - ASAP
        - Else could make users **hesitant**
    - Find someone 


Notes:
If you're building an app alone, it is certainly for someone you know, speak to this person/these people 
ASAP : talk to **users** ASAP else they could be **hesitant** to give their ideas if the **prototype** is **too finished** = you spend lot of time, 





VVVVV
## Question 5

What's the hardest part of design ?

- No right answer, only good directions to try
- No **universal must be**
- Depends on **users**
- Depends on **constraints**

Notes:
- Depends on users, 
- must be comfortable with a certain amount of **mess** and **uncertainty**, because that's how the process works. Because it's a creative process.



VVVVV
## Summary

**Best design process ? Depend on the context**

- Could be interesting to include end users in the process
- If not possible, think about what end users would appreciate

# Design Methodologies

VVVVV
## Structure: Few types of design methodologies to consider 

- Iterative design,
- System centered design, 
- User centered design, 
- Participatory design,
- Designer centered design

VVVVV
## Iterative design 

![](https://framapic.org/akc230npK9qW/yl2jf0AYFGfo.png)

Notes:
- Req : example : authentication method w/ lists of requirements
    - Users are able to log in 
    - Checks to be done on the password to make sure it is secure enough
- Design : many possible ways
- Dev : build the system or prototype
- Test : test it

VVVVV
## Iterative design 

![](https://framapic.org/sXpOch89gms1/PxJBIZSrWqgi.png)

Notes:
- In all of the stages we can go back to a previous stage to make some changes
    - When doing design we may realize that some requirements are missing and go back to the requirements stage
- Remark : As you can see, the author of the video has clearly respected what was said in the previous section, do not have a prototype to much finished [...]
	- See Guy Kawasaky's speech on entrepreneurship. Don't wait for the product to be "finished" ... because it never will be!

VVVVV
## System Centered Design

- What can be built easily on this platform?
- What can I create from the available tools?
- What can I do as a programmer that I find interesting to work on?

Notes:
- Does not involve a lot of users or resources
- Used methodology
- Example : Building **authentication system** for mobile device
    - could take lot of time
    - "useless" if the platform already support different ways to do so
    - **Is it worth ?**
        - could also differentiate products



VVVVV
## Human Centered Design 

- Design w/ human computer interaction
    - Abilities and users need
    - Context 
    - Work
    - Tasks
- **Know the user**

Notes:
- Focused on users and their importance to the system
- Context of work of users
- Work & tasks they have to do
- **Golden rule : know the user**

VVVVV
## Example

![](https://framapic.org/tSVsKEiXPwOD/s3fyowY0boF2.png)

Notes:
- Design of computer on wheels for physicians (hey why use laptops ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯), is an example where **user centered design was not followed**
    - Context, ability, work & task : nothing taken into account

VVVVV
## Participatory Design

- Sort of user centered design

Prob:

- Wrong intuitions
- Not precise interviews
- Can not known enough the users to solve all issue on the design phase

Sol:

- Have access to end users

Notes:
- UCD : where users are actually brought into the design process
- Intuitions : designers intuitions can be wrong 
- Interview not enough precise, more questions when designing and do not have the answer, have **to guess**
- See Cialdini: implication. In Cybersecurity, this could increase acceptance. If they reach the conclusion by themselves
- See active (deeper understanding) versus expositive (scales better) methodologies
- Group effectif you need to make 200 reach the conclusion themselves ... maybe only 50 will but showing to others that it can be reached.

VVVVV
## Designer Centered Design

"It isn't the consumer's job to know what they want" -- *Steve Jobs*

Notes:
* Include the customer is ok but at some point, designers have to do their job and come with new ideas
* Careful not to make the confusion of "success = good arguments". You could have succeeded by luck.


VVVVV
## Conclusion

- Users can give insight,
- Methodology to support designers in coming up with new ideas
- Iterate to build better systems

# C.S. SSL Warnings

Notes:
- Section on **experiment** on SSL warnings in browser 
- Goal : observe if **lambda user** can **understand** the warning and **react accordingly**

VVVVV
## Example user

- Observe user 
- Can user understand ? 
    - React accordingly ?
    
Notes:
* Nowadays, some applications are luring users away from self signed certificate saying that it automatically mean that there is a MitM attack and making it very hard, when possible, to check the fingerprint. This is a problem for us in Cybersecurity. Self-signed does not always mean less secure.
	* we have been doing it for ssh connexion without any trouble as long as you follow the right procedure
	* you do not need to trust a central autority for your PKI. So one could assume that when following the right procedure (that is a costly one of checking the fingerprint through a authenticated channel that ensure integrity), it is more secure
	* in some browsers, you cannot even accept the exeption. you need to accept it in private navigation and then continue your browsing in the main window.
I have also seen android applications that either do not support at all self signed (rocket chat, mattermost) or only allow you to check a box "do not check certificate" which removes all the benefits of TLS


VVVVV
## Context 

- Small experiment about SSL Warning when issue with certificate

Notes:
- A user is asked react to an alert/error regarding SSL on Firefox 2/3 browser



VVVVV
## Results 

- User has no idea what's going on, 
    - He supposes, something bad


**How to improve this ?**

Notes:
- The user has no idea what's going on, and it's normal, because he is a lambda user 
- Firefox error messages are not comprehensible by lambda users 


VVVVV
## What's going on 

- Certificate error could be due to :
    - Local clock mis-configured, or
    - **MITM**

- Idea : browsers should prevent users to continue, but :

VVVVV
## What users think 

- "I use a Mac so nothing bad would happen"
- "Since I use FreeBSD, rather than Windows, not much [risk]"
- "On my Linux box, nothing significantly bad would happen"

Notes:
These people trust their OS rather than the browser alert

## What users think 

![](https://framapic.org/pV28chfrSqc3/56PFIOYhdgtR.png)

Notes:
- Quite different results with different interfaces
- Image source : Usable Security - Jennifer Golbeck - 3 - 4 - Case Study_ SSL Warnings - paper discussion (15_20): [https://www.coursera.org/learn/usable-security](https://www.coursera.org/learn/usable-security)


VVVVV
## Idea 

- Test different User Interface
- Compare the results 
- User interfaces play a role in security 

Notes:
Paper idea is to test different design of browser to see if there is a behavior change for the users

# Interview SSL

VVVVV
## Structure 

- Professor Lorrie Cranor - Carnegie Mellon University
- 4 questions
	- Usable privacy and security = ?
	- Enough attention to usability in security?
	- Lessons learned from ssl study?
	- Interface design <-> secure user behavior?

VVVVV
## Q1

"*What is usable privacy and security?*"

- Wide range of areas
- Making privacy policies more usable
- Consumer privacy tools

Notes:
Really vague, idk what she's talking about



VVVVV
## Q2

"*Is the security community paying enough attention to users and usability?*"

- No, 
- More *focused on back-end algorithms*
    - Someone else should worry about usability 

VVVVV
## Q3

"*What do the results of your SSL Warning study say about how interface affects users behavior?*"

- "I've seen this before, it's never been important before, I'm just going to click through it."
- Wanted to change that,
    - Make it different ; change the design to **red**
    - Force user interaction, can't just click;
        - Answer a question

VVVVV
## Q4

"*How does interface design impact user behavior in security systems more broadly?*"

- "When the interface **looks like something you've seen before** you're just going to keep behaving the way you've always behaved and if you **change the interface**, you can at least **temporarily get a change of behavior**."
- Security = mostly annoyance for lambda users
    - Want to get trough ASAP
    - Requiring **too much concentration lead to bad results**
        - Physician example

VVVVV
<!-- .slide: data-background="  #456789" -->
### Iterative Design: user interface design experiment
- Scenarios
	- Designing User Interfaces for film company  requiring custom system for tracking equipment, props & customs 
	- Business unit involved is unaccustomed to providing requirements for technology
- A possible outcome from the development team
	- Go off for month & create something that users end up of rejecting
	
VVVVV
<!-- .slide: data-background="  #456789" -->
### Iterative Design: user interface design experiment cont'
- Solution
	- Adopting iterative design approach
	- Users and developers sit together twice a week
	- Go through the current system
	- Users try things & generate new requirements that are strictly prioritized to a few days
	- In this way system evolves to be useful and easy to use
