# The rule of reciprocation 

VVVVV
## The rule 

"We should try to repay, in kind, what another person has provided us."

Experiment based on sending email Christmas card. Send cards to strangers and observe if a card is sent in return. In most of the cases, a card is sent back. (done by a university professor)

## Examples 

- if a woman does us a favor, we should do her one in return,
- if a man sends us a birthday present, we should remember his birthday with a gift of our own,
- if a couple invite us to a party, we should be sure to invite them to one of ours

By virtue of the reciprocity rule, then, we are obligated to the future repayment of favors, gifts, invitations, and the like 

Sociologist Alvin Gouldner reports that there is no human society that does not subscribe to the rule

## Sanctions
Social sanctions if this rule is not respected. We associate negativity with the type of person who does not follow the rule. 

Because of this negativity, we try to respect the rule. This is where it cloud be used against us.

Notes:
Reason we follow the rule


VVVVV
## Experiment by Professor Dennis Regan 

The experiment is about demonstrating the rule. 

VVVVV
## Context

- Subject : Someone subject of the experiment,
- Joe : Someone testing the behavior of the subject.

VVVVV
## Experiment

- Both (Joe and the subject) are rating paintings,
- During a break, Joe buys 2 bottles of Coca-Cola, one for him, and the other for the subject,
- The subject then "owes" a favor to Joe,
- After their rating job, Joe tries to sell some raffle tickets to the subject,

The major finding of the study is the Joe was twice more successful when trying to sell tickets to the subject when he did a favor to the subject previously.

VVVVV
## Type of reciprocation

Notes:
- Emotional reciprocation 
	- Say thank you, explain that we are very pleased to work in this beautiful company, ...
		- IE: When you come in a shop : "hello, how are you, ..."
- Material / financial reciprocation
	- Help people to load their car
	- Loan money to people and they want to pay it back (like the diner) 
	- Negative actions : will talk later about it in negative reciprocation
- The more question you ask and listen closely, the more people like you

## General principle

- Conflict between parties 
	- Start to have a dispute 
	- One party is rude with the other one 
	- Each side respond to the other one 
	- Negative reciprocation 

<!-- .slide: data-background=" #c32c2c" -->

VVVVV

## How to detect it

- Characterised by repeated contentious communication
- Select fact to confirm the point of view 
	- They will always take the exemple that goes into the way of their opinion (the negative feeling) 

<!-- .slide: data-background=" #c32c2c" -->

VVVVV

## When does this occur ? 

- Cross cultural-negotiation 
	- Differences at three levels:
		- Differences in internalised values and norms
		- Differences in emotional expression 
		- Differences in linguistic style

Notes:
- Values and norms
	- Not everyone defends the same values 
- Emotional 
	- Not everyone reacts in the same way in front of a situation
- Linguistic style 
	- Some expressions could be misunderstood by another one

# The rule is overpowering

VVVVV
## Power of the rule

"The rule possesses awesome strength, often producing a "yes" response to a request that, except for an existing feeling of indebtedness, would surely have been refused."

VVVVV
## Liking effect

"Regan was also interested in how liking for a person affects the tendency to comply with that person's request."

Based on the previous experiment, it was asked to the subjects to fill several rating scales indicating how much they liked Joe.

VVVVV
## Liking effect 
<!-- cont' -->

It was, of course, obvious that the subjects liking him, feeling indebted or not, did him a favor and bought some tickets.

The interesting part is about subjects feeling indebted. The link between compliance and liking was completely wiped out. Even for subjects disliking Joe, when Joe did them a favor (by buying them a Coke), they felt a sense to repay him and they did.

The rule was so strong that it overwhelmed the influence of the liking factor.

VVVVV
## IE. - Krishnas

The Hare Krishna Society had an issue with its funding. Its economy was based on donations. For that, the Society members would canvass a city street. But their "special" look did not sell well.

They switched strategies by giving gifts, books, or in the most cost-effective version, a flower. The passerby would be offered a gift (under no circumstances allowed to give it back) were then under the force of the reciprocation rule to make a contribution to the Society.

<!-- ## Exmpl. - Politics

The rule can also be found in politics : 

- Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter favors to the Congress,
- Local political organization favors to the citizens -->

VVVVV
## Free sample 

The "free sample", as a gift can also engage the reciprocity rule. 

The promoter who gives the free samples can release the natural indebting force while innocently appearing to have only the intention to inform.

VVVVV
## Amway BUG

Amway Corporation uses a "BUG" (a collection of Amway various products) to trigger the reciprocity rule. 

The Bug is left at a customer's house for 24 to 72 hours, and is when it is picked up by a sales representative, the customer has been trapped under the influence of the reciprocity rule. The customer then orders some the of the various Amway products.

VVVVV
## WWI 

Based on the account of a German soldier to the European scientist Eilb-Eibesfeldt,

It was not possible the cross the battlefield during the war, but some expert soldiers were able to cross by crawling alone across it. The objective was to capture and interrogate an enemy soldier. 

VVVVV
## WWI cont'

"The German expert of our account,[..] surprised a lone enemy soldier[..]. The unsuspecting soldier, who had been eating at that time, was easily disarmed. The frightened captive with only a piece of bread in his hand than performed what may have been the most important act of his life. He gave his enemy some of the bread. So affected was the German by this gift that he could not complete his mission. He turned from his benefactor and recrossed the no-man's-land empty-handed to face the wrath of his superiors."

VVVVV
## Conclusion

"The rule possesses awesome strength, often producing a "yes" response to a request that, except for an existing feeling of indebtedness, would surely have been refused."


>>>>>
# The rule enforces uninvited debts

VVVVV
## Unwanted gifts

"There is an obligation to give, an obligation to receive, and an obligation to repay" [Marcel Mauss]

Unwanted gifts are used to enforce the rule. "[..] an uninvited first favor must have the ability to create an obligation." 

"The obligation to repay constitutes the essence of the reciprocity rule, it is the obligation to receive that makes the rule so easy to exploit. The obligation to receive reduces our ability to choose whom we wish to be indebted to and puts that power in the hands of others"

VVVVV
## Example - Regan

It was all along Joe's decision to make the first favor. As Joe had already purchased the Coke, it would have been awkward to refuse; Joe had already spent his money. In the experiment, not a single subject refused the Coke.

It was also Joe's suggestion for the return favor.

VVVVV
## Exmpl. - Krishnas

The "gifts" used by the Krishnas is a similar example; 

- They "force" their targets to accept their "gift" by taking them by surprise, 
- Do not accept the gift to be returned,
- And then propose a donation as a returning gift. 

The flowers used as gifts are then, in most cases, thrown away. They are then recovered by the Krishnas to be used against other people.

>>>>>
# The rule can trigger unfair exchanges

VVVVV
## Context 

"A small initial favor can produce a sense of obligation to agree to a substantially larger return favor."

"The rule allows one person to choose the nature of the indebting first and the nature of the debt-canceling return favor, we could be easily manipulated into an unfair exchange by those who might wish to exploit the rule"

VVVVV
## Example - Regan

The experiment was done in the late 1960, where the price of a Coke was about 10 cents. The raffle tickets sold by Joe was 25 cents/piece. 

The average of sold tickets by Joe after giving a coke was 5. Joe made 500% return.

VVVVV
## Student account

One of the students of the author had a car issue, it does not start. Someone helped the student to start the car and she gave her address this someone to return the favor if the opportunity arose.

One day this someone came and ask for a return favor, borrow the student's car. The student felt obligated but uncertain. She later discovered that the person was underage and had no insurance. The person totaled the car.

VVVVV
## Why ?

Why would it be that a small first favor often stimulates larger return favors ? Most of us find it highly disagreeable to be in a state of obligation. 

Just to be sure to benefit of other favors in the future we are ready to accept to return a biggest favor than the original one to be free of the psychological burden of debt.

Another reason is that not returning a favor may conduct to be disliked of the social group.

# Reciprocal concessions

- Propose something more **"reasonable"**

## Foot in the door

- Foot in the door >< Concession 
- Start with a **small request**
- End up with a **largest request**

Notes: 
- Different from the Door in the face because we do not do any concession 
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #c32c2c" -->

Notes:

<!-- .slide: data-background=" #c32c2c" -->

VVVVV

## The rule 

As seen previously, a consequence of the rule is an obligation to repay favors we have received. Another consequence of the rule, however, is an obligation to make a concession to someone who has made a concession to us.

VVVVV
## Example 

- A Boy Scout is trying to sell tickets for the circus ($5) to the author, 
- The author declines, 
- The Scout than propose buying him some chocolate bars ($1),
- The author accepts

The interesting thing is that the author does not like chocolate.

VVVVV
## Explanations

The concession ($5 -> $1) done by the scout triggered the reciprocity rule and then the author also did a concession automatically without to have to think about it.

Example of how a weapon of automatic influence can infuse a compliance request with its power.

**"The tendency to reciprocate a concession is not so strong that it will invariably work in all instances on all people."**

In the previous example it was strong enough to work on the author.

VVVVV
## Rejection-then-retreat

The previous example is an example of the rejection-then-retreat technique. This technique is based on +2 requests ;

- The first request has to be larger than the one wished to be accepted, 
- The second and following requests have to be smaller than the initial one and are supposed to be the request(s) wished to be accepted

VVVVV
## Experiment

The author and his research assistants performed an experiment on students. This experiment was about determining if the 'size' of the requests should only be small requests or if this technique could be used for larger requests.

To test the effectiveness of the technique, the same request was made to students, but with or without a first larger request. 

VVVVV
## Requests

The wished request was : 

- Would the students be willing to chaperon a group of juvenile delinquents on a day trip to the zoo unpaid

And the larger request was : 

- Spend 2 hours per week as a counselor to a juvenile delinquent for a minimum of 2 years.

VVVVV
## Results

- When **only** the wished request was asked, the refusal percentage was 83%,
- When the wished request was asked after the larger request, the refusal percentage was 50%

VVVVV
## Backfire 

However, a research conducted by the University of Bar-Ilan in Israel shows that if the first request is so extreme that it is considered unreasonable by the subject, than the tactic backfires.

This is due to the fact that the party doing this first unreasonable request is then not considered as bargaining in good faith and then the first requests is not seen as a genuine concession and thus not reciprocated.

The first request should not be extremely exaggerated for this tactic to work. There is a fair balance to be found between exaggeration and the request we want to obtain.

VVVVV
## Example 

Chapter 1 Sweatshirt vs. Suit selling order.

As seen in chapter 1 selling the suit first and the sweater second expose the most expensive price then the cheapest one. The second price is then not seen as expensive, even if the sweater is overpriced because the first item was more expensive.

VVVVV
## Watergate example

Political context:

- $1M
- $500K
- **$250K**

VVVVV
## Cons ?

Is there any side effects related to the usage of this tactic ?

A study published in Canada studied a subquestion : will the victim respect his or her commitment? The study was realized around a specific request : work unpaid for 2 hours in a community mental health agency. The results are the following : 

- 76% accepted with rejection-then-retreat tactic,
- 29% without

Show up results : 

- 85% showed up with rejection-then-retreat tactic,
- 50% without

VVVVV
## Blood example 

Another study was realized on students. 1 of the 2 groups of students was the victim of the rejection-then-retreat tactic. Both groups were asked to give blood. 


For the students who agreed to give their blood, after giving their blood, they were then asked is they would be willing to give their phone numbers so they could be called upon to donate again in the future.

- 84% of victims of the rejection-then-retreat tactic gave their number, 
- 43% of non-victim students gave their number.

VVVVV
## Why ? 

These surprising results are due to the return concession and more precisely due to the feel of greater responsibility for, and satisfaction with the agreement.

This set of sweet side effect that enables the tactic to move its victims to fulfill their agreements and to engage in further such agreements.

VVVVV
## UCLA Study

Social psychologists at UCLA performed the following experiment; subjects were instructed to negotiate an amount of money to share with an opponent. This same opponent was an accomplice of the experiment. 3 scenarios were performed on various subjects :

- The accomplice did the first extreme proposal : keep most of the money, if not all of it, for him, and stubbornly persist to keep this proposal, 
- The accomplice did the first less extreme proposal  : keep most of the money, but not all, for him, and stubbornly persist to keep this proposal, 
- The accomplice did the first extreme proposal : but performed the rejection-then-retreat tactic,

VVVVV
## Results

2 results were observed on the subject with the rejection-then-retreat tactic;

VVVVV
## Responsibility 

The subjects felt more responsible for the last deal about the money. Even if it was not the case, because it was all about the accomplice tactic, the felt more responsible for the deal. "A person who feels responsible for the terms of a contract will be more likely to live up to that contract."


VVVVV
## Satisfaction

Compared to the firsts 2 tactics (non-rejection-then-retreat), the subjects of the rejection-then-retreat tactic received more money. It appeared that an agreement that has been forged through the concessions of one's opponent is quite satisfying.

Due to this satisfaction, "the victims are more likely to feel more satisfied with the agreement as a result. And it stands to reason that people who are satisfied with a given arrangement are more likely to be willing to agree to further such agreement."

VVVVV

## Conclusion 

- Door in the face
	- Concession
- Foot in the door
	- "Abuse"

# How to say no

VVVVV
## How to ? 

The first solution would be to say no to everything. In this case there is 2 possible output : 

- Congratulations : you just escaped the tactical grip,
- You just hurt the feelings of an authentic generous individual.

VVVVV
## Example 

A little girl who distributes flowers at the entrance of her school party, refusing this authentic gift can hurt the feelings of the little girl. The scenario happened to the daughter of a friend of the author.

VVVVV
## Second solution 

A more promising solution could be to accept the first favor, and then see what are the intentions of the person;

- In the case of the little girl, there was no return favor to be asked, it was just a welcome gift, 
- In the case of someone (a profiteer) trying to use tricks to obtain a bigger favor, this could be the time to react to it accordingly to be free of its influence


VVVVV
## Example 

Let's imagine receiving a call for a free fire inspecting of our home. 

To this call, there is 2 intentions possible : 

- A 'legitimate' call from a non-profit association offering this kind of service,
- A call from a fire-alarm company trying to make a first favor in order to make profits

As you cannot know the intentions of the caller, let's assume we accept.

VVVVV
## Cont'

The fire examiner comes, gives us a small fire extinguisher, inspect our home and then of based on his intentions there are 2 possible outcomes : 

- Non-profit : he simply leaves, 
- Sales : he then suggests you buy an overpriced fire-alarm and starts his sales speech,

At this moment the intentions of the person are crystal-clear. If we have the sales person in front of us, the 'favor' previously offered as to be seen as a sales tactic and not as an authentic generous gift. Therefore, we are (or not) welcome to politely thank him and show him the door.

## Summary
A salesman reported the rejection-then-retreat method as working in his sales job; the salesman obtained a better sale % by presenting first a 3 years plan ($140), and then retreating to a 1-year plan ($35).
