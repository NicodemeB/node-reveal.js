# House On ELM Street Negotiation Tactics 

VVVVV
###  Recalling Negotiation Key Tactics

- Get to know the other side 
- Understanding your power 
	- Find the other party BATNA
	- The weaken its power
- Use psychology tools - and avoid traps

Notes: Listen carefully and ask question.  Ask question and listening carefully does give you more power
By gathering information you can find out their BATNA, 
Weaken their power 
improve your power

VVVVV
### Understanding your power : Pat Perspective

- Asking question about:
    - The uncle  (Name, age so and so)
    - The reason the house is being sold
- Buyer capitalizing on house needs for renovation


VVVVV
### Understanding your power : Stacy Perspective
- Audio 6.57 minutes
- By Asking question tracy may know:
	- The buyer's second alternative: buy house from the other street
	- Invoking impact of demolishing on the company's reputation
	
- Renovating the house
- Looking for other alternatives 
	
Notes: 
    - Tracy may argue that demolishing the a beautiful house from the other street in residential area  then demolishing
      it may drive protest  and damaging the company's reputation. This this will help Tracy  weaken Pat's BATNA

- Looking for other alternatives 
	- Tracy should alternatively searching for other potential buyers
	
- From the beginning, buyer was reluctant to leak informations, but as she is kept being asked I could get more information from her
	
VVVVV
### Use psychology tools : Anchoring
- Brief review:
    - Anchoring or focalism is a cognitive bias where an individual depends too heavily on an initial piece of
     information offered (considered to be the "anchor") when making decisions (Wikipedia)
     
- The question  here: 
    - Which stretch goal should  be revealed first?
    
Notes: 
    sources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring
    
    Ideally here if possible, Tracy should keep question Pat and bring him to put his price first on the table
    as she does have less alternative. 
    
    If Tracy first reveal her stretch goal, Two situation may arise:
        1- She ask for much: which may not be helpful and leads to lose of credibility
        2- or she throws a price way bellow 250 000$ that Pat was ready to pay, which may make the deal two easy
        
VVVVV
###  Use psychology tools : Anchoring (Cont')

- In  this use case: 
    - Buyer presses seller to first reveal the price
    - Initial anchoring value: $270K
    
VVVVV
###  Use psychology tools : Availability 
	- Relying on  taxes values
	
	- Relying on recent sales history
	
Notes:
    - During our  negotiation  the buyer has heavily  referred to these information in order to leverage her BATNA  weaken  our proposal. That help her to really make a solid argument for her proposal
    
VVVVV
###  Use psychology tools : Escalation
	
	- Negotiator should look at the negotiation from the other side's perspective
	
	- Pat could  eventually 
		- Take into consideration that the uncle is old man With poor health condition 
	
VVVVV
###  Use psychology tools : Reciprocation

VVVVV
###  Use psychology tools : Big Picture Perspective

# Mythical Pie Assumption & Big-picture perspective

- How these elements could change the result of our negotiation ?

VVVVV

![](https://framapic.org/VYifR5ktaLnu/5gnHJWbVVKd7)

Notes: 
    The negotiation has been started with 250K. The key point here is how much of that money went to the seller and how much do go to the buyer?
    
VVVVV

![](https://framapic.org/kvIgkJaR3dNU/2ypv20fRs8Od)
Notes: 
    - Regardless of whether a negotiation appears to be position-based or interest based, always search for underlying interest in an attempt to build a larger pie.
    - But also be ready for positional bargaining even after finding mutual interests

VVVVV
###  How could we build a larger pie?

![](https://framapic.org/3VglfvRJNKi1/oWkfj6Z0fKxl)

Notes: 
    How can we build a larger bag of money where:
		- the seller can walk away with 200 K 
		- the buyer walk away with 200K?

    
VVVVV
### The interest based analysis

![](https://framapic.org/gsnJPBs4nMko/7XBRsNCCgjbP)

    
VVVVV
### Important key underlying  points
- Why does the uncle do need 150K?
	- For a senior  apartment
	
    
VVVVV
### Search  for conflicting interests
- The seller needs to keep the house for 3 months vs Buyer needs within one month
- The seller needs as much money as possible vs Buyer 

    
VVVVV
### Non-conflicting interest
- Seller needs at least  150K for senior apt 
							 Versus 
- Company builds senior apartment: sales are slow
 
Notes: 
     - The non-conflicting interest may be used to build a larger pie

VVVVV
### Connecting the dot

![](https://framapic.org/XD15xp2BFX9u/SFWDyuJmukEj)

VVVVV
### Solution one analysis

- The company would end up saving $ 20K
- The uncle would end up with $ 200K  House
- Tracy interest could have been met 
- Pat could get his  job

VVVVV
