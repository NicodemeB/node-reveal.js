## Introduction

- Usable privacy

 - Privacy policies

 - Privacy controls

<aside class="notes">
  Users  control how data use as much.</br></br>
  understand whom giving authority to</br></br>

tell a user everything they need to know about how their data are </br>- collected, 
</br>- used </br>-and shared</br></br>

  privacy policy clear to users </br></br> explain all necessary details without overwhelming them.

<aside class="notes">
 average person can understand</br> 
 Pretty easy to understand. </br>
 well organized categories
</br></br>
 accessible language
</aside>

<aside class="notes">
 big block of text </br>
 words like api (down in the picture) </br>
 relatively accessible

<aside class="notes">
 Very legal</br></br>
technical terms and reference</br></br>
not usable </br></br>
not designed with reader in mind
</aside>
 
VVVVV

## Introduction

- Usable privacy

- Privacy policies

- __Privacy controls__

<aside class="notes">
 should allow  user </br></br> say whether or not data should be collected </br></br> who has permission to see it
 
 </aside>
 
VVVVV

## Example: Iphone location services

 <aside class="notes">
 I can take back the permission to access my location </br>
 for each app!!
</aside>
 
VVVVV
 
## Going forward
 
- Privacy and security are part of the same issue
- Analysing usability is done the same way with privacy
- Keep the user in mind first
 
<aside class="notes">
- Because we are handeling authorization </br>
- Privacy management should be part of natural workflow (pitfalls)
</br></br>

- like we saw with the iphone or the policy, it needs to be easy to use

# Privacy policies and user understanding

VVVVV
 
## Issues

- About 16% of people read them
- 50% of people who read the policies, don't understand them
- Even Facebook data use policy lack of  clarity


<aside class="notes">
        understanding privacy policies  is  critical  for  users  to control their privacy</br></br>
        
        need to know whats being done with their data and what the options are. </br></br> If document that spells that out is inaccessible and hard to read -> people won't understand what's going on</br></br>
        
        Facebook is not hard to read but long & doesn't go into detail, about what Apps or what people, can access what parts of the profile
</aside>

VVVVV
 
## Experiment

- People are asked about what their app can access
- They are iether shown the video "Take this lollipop" or asked to read facebook privacy policies
- They had underestimated what the app can access
- Those who had seen the video had a better understanding of what can be access 

<aside class="notes">
         interactive horror movie</br></br> integrates data from  Facebook profile into, a prescripted film (it's down)</br></br>

        privacy policies still not very clear
</aside>

VVVVV
 
## Going forward

- Privacy policies have a poor usability
 - Boring
 - Hard to read
 - User preference is against it
 - Lead to missunderstanding
 
- The video worked better, first step

<aside class="notes">
- Boring and hard to read</br></br>

- toward usable privacy policies

# Informed Consent

<aside class="notes">
 informed consent: </br>     users understand: </br>  - what data are being collected and shared</br>-   and  to how they are used</br></br>
 
 commonly used in research ethics</br></br>
 
 example, if you have a patient trying a new cancer drug you want them to be fully informed of all the risks, and to consent to participate in that medical study
</aside>

VVVVV
 ##  Six components required for informed consent in online privacy systems

1. __Disclosure__
2. Comprehension
3. Voluntariness
4. Competence
5. Agreement
6. Minimal distraction

<aside class="notes">
 
</aside>

VVVVV
 
## Disclosure: what will be done with their data

- What is going to be collected?
- Who has access to it?
- How long is it archived?
- What is it used for?
- How the individual's identity will be protected?

<aside class="notes">
 explaining is the first step </br></br> no surpise here

<aside class="notes">
  Users need to understand what you've disclosed(explain) to them. </br></br>
  Exemple, if you have a technical document that does disclose all this information </br> eight year old child reading it </br> unlikely comprehension

<aside class="notes">
 no way to coerce the user into sharing their data</br>
 They're not being forced to do it, they're not being manipulated</br></br>
 
 Exemple of non Voluntariness</br>
 users manipulated into thinking there would be serious repercussions to their life, if they didn't share their data the way you want them to

 people having the mental emotional and physical capabilities needed to give informed consent. </br></br>
 
 children will be an example of a group that may not be compitent to give informed consent</br></br>
 
 United State the children's online privacy protection act, or COPA doesn't allow children 12 and under to give consent. </br>
 It requires their parents to give permission.

<aside class="notes">
not overwhelm users with information </br></br>
straightforward process & agreement </br>
NDLR: should make the link with GDPR and other privacy framework
NDLR: why not use the "Notes:" separator and use the aside class tag instead?
</aside>

VVVVV
 
## Example Google

![](https://framapic.org/zJazIkLv4Qf2/jwwQLc2mb1hn.PNG)

<aside class="notes">
comprehensive: yes </br>
- very understandable language</br>
- structure </br>
- links for more infos </br></br>

voluntariness: yes nothing to coerce </br></br>

competence: depend on user </br>
but google say children can't sign up without adult permission

</br></br> user have to agree before use -> agreement explicit & required </br></br> quite short / nothing distracting -> minimal distraction

## Facebook experiment

- 700 000 users
- emotional state affected by tweaked newsfeed that show only positive or negative post
- _"one option is for internal operations including trouble shooting, data analysis, testing, research and service improvement."_ _facebook term of consent_

https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/01/facebook-socially-irresponsible 
<aside class="notes">
 
 didn't tell but </br>
 justify by a clause in term of consent</br></br>
 
 disclosure " one option is for internal operations including trouble shooting, data analysis, testing, research and service improvement." </br>
 don't answer the questions seen above</br>
comprehension: no since people were shocked and surprised

voluntary <- value in facebook profile that they have to shut down

NDLR: why isnt the link posted in link format in the link pad too? do not forget labels and at least a sentence of why one should look the video and what they should remember from it and how it is relevant/linked to the topic it is illustrating (so labels, full reference/title, and summary)
NDLR: dont forget to archive files, webpages, videos etc.
NDLR: url etc. always include full ref -> "last access" etc.

</aside>

VVVVV
 
## See GDPR

- Article 6: Lawfulness of processing
- Article 7: Conditions for consent


Notes:
* same ideas can now be found in the law
* NDLR: include quotes, and focus etc. what you mean by that, what is the attention point, the key element to understand, what should we remember about it (go back to the informative speech evaluation rubriks as a checklist)

VVVVV
## Biggest difference/addition I could think of
 
_"When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract."_ _GDPR Article 7.4_


<aside class="notes">
if experiment of facebook was done today, that would be a big issue </br></br>
this wasn't in the video's definition

# Pitfalls of Privacy

VVVVV
 
## Two categories of pitfalls

- Understanding
 - Obscuring potential information flow
 - Obscuring actual information flow
-  Action
 - Emphasizing configuration over action
 - Lacking coarse-grained control
 - Inhibiting established practice

<aside class="notes">
        two main pitfalls </br> </br>
        start with understanding
</aside>

VVVVV
 
## Information flow

- Who is it shared with? 
- What kind of information is it? 
- Who are the people who will see that information? 
- The media through which it's conveyed. 
- Length of retention
- Potential for unintended disclosure
- Collection of metadata

<aside class="notes">
encompass

Obscuring potential information flow: </br></br>
Exemple Gmail adds</br>
Advertisement targeted based on the content of the mails</br>
What are they really doing?</br></br></br></br>

Obscuring actual information flow:</br></br>
Iphone picks up the most common place you go to </br>
coordinate</br>
no consent asked</br>
no obvious way to change taht setting</br>
also hidden and menu </br>
concealed and no control over it

</aside>

VVVVV
 
## Two categories of pitfalls

- Understanding
 - Obscuring potential information flow
 - Obscuring actual information flow
-  __Action__
 - Emphasizing configuration over action
 - Lacking coarse-grained control
 - Inhibiting established practice

<aside class="notes">
        now let's talk about action
</aside>

VVVVV
 
## Emphasizing configuration over action

- Privacy management should be part of natural workflow

<aside class="notes">
 no specific complicate settings </br>
 just like security  </br>  </br>
 facebook choose friends or family or everyone - who can see
</aside>

VVVVV
 
## Lacking coarse-grained control

- Have an obvious, top-level control to turn sharing on and off
- Buying for someone on amazon (private mode)
- Facebook post 

<aside class="notes">
 switch privacy level </br>
 turn off data collection for a while like airplane mode </br> </br>
 exemple1 buying something for someone on amazon and avoid suggestion </br> </br>
 exemple2 facebook let you choose "public friend and custom" for your post </br> do it well
</aside>

VVVVV
 
## Inhibiting established practice

- What do users expect from other experiences?
- Conventions 

<aside class="notes">
franky and nancy video </br>
phone says location during call </br>
not convention </br>
lack of privacy
</aside>

VVVVV

## Exemple of video explaining privacy settings on youtube

*<figure class="video_container">
*  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IWlyut4zsko" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"> </iframe></figure>

VVVVV
 
## Conclusion

- Make it clear how information is being shared
- Controlling privacy should be easy and natural
- Make default practice match users expectations

# Inferring Personal Data and Policy

VVVVV
 
## Introduction

- Facebook 1.2 billion users per month
- Behavioral, preference, demographic data for hundreds of millions of people
- Target exemple

<aside class="notes">

thanks to fb we have amount of private data like never before </br> </br>

target </br>
15 yo girl</br> 
</br>
diapers</br> 
sent advertisement 3 weeks before she told her parent </br></br>
look inooncent: more vitamin, hand bag big enough to old diapers</br> 
little pattern of behavior that detected in mass reveal lot's of things
</aside>

VVVVV
 
## Prediction

- Political preference
- Personality score
- Gender
- Sexual orientation
- Religion
- Age
- How much you trust people you know

<aside class="notes">

little pattern of behavior that detected in mass reveal lot's of things</br></br>

political preference</br>
your political preference, your personality score, gender, sexual orientation, religion, age, intelligence</br>
how much you trust people you know


</aside>

VVVVV
 
## Little pattern of behavior

- Liking curly fries means you are probably smart
- Homophily

<aside class="notes">

not obvious </br> </br>
exemple: facebook likes study</br>
5 likes more indicative of intelligence: liking curly fries</br></br>

homophily</br>
people are friend with people like them</br>
smart people friend with smart people </br>
so someone smart started the page and his friens liked then their friends liked...</br></br>

could be done for hr companies that try to predict your behavior 

</aside>

VVVVV
 
## Solutions

- Company won't seed control of their main asset back to the users
- Develop mechanisms that can say to a user the risk of the action he just took

<aside class="notes">

could be done for hr companies that try to predict your behavior </br></br>

Solutions?</br>
how do you get a company, to seed control of their main asset back to the users</br>
develop mechanisms that can say to a user, here's the risk of that action you just took.</br>
</br></br>
by sharing this piece of personal information, you've now improved my ability to predict whether or not you're using drugs or whether or not you get along well in the workplace. </br>
affect whether or not people want to share something




</aside>

VVVVV

## Conclusion

- Ethical approach
- Encouraging those kind of science

<aside class="notes">
if I use data I should have been given the right to use those data</br></br>
that empowered user base by finding ways to ask the permission
</aside>

>>>>>

# Conclusion

VVVVV

## Conclusion

- Privacy policies have a poor usability
- Keep the user in mind first
- Think about encouraging comprehension trough complementary ways
- Make it clear how information is being shared
- Controlling privacy should be easy and natural
- Empower the users with ethical approach
