## B role structure 

- <a href=#/15/4>Overconfidence</a>
	1. China + USA
	2. Exagetared example
	3. Avoid it
- **Framing**
	1. Social experiment on the beach 
	2. TED Talk Dan Ariely → default effect
- **Availability**
	1. Social experiment around finance 
- **Contrast principle**


Notes:

**Cognitive bias**

- Overconfidence:
	1. China produced in real life but **not real good example** because there is no overconfidence example in the video 
	2. Overconfidence example: exaggerated
- Framing:
	1. Social experiment on the beach 
	2. Dan Ariely: Ted talk → first seen as a framing effect by myself, before being announced as the Default Effect by Dan Ariely in the video → still interesting 
- Availability 
	1. Social experiment around finance 
- Contrast principle: 
	1. Already talked about that last week by, when watching the TED Talk of Dan Ariely → saw the rubies cube example with only the centers remaining

# Power of negotiation

VVVVV
## Source

- Information 
    - Ask a lot of questions
        - To analyse the position and interests
        - Important to listen 
            - 2 ears and 1 mouth to listen more than we speak
    - BATNA 

Notes:
- Women's brain work fully to listen 
- Only 1 part of the brain of men work to listen
    - Need to focus more 


VVVVV
## Source of power 

- Two factors
    - Conceptual knowledge 
        - Experience in the business 
        - Understanding the business 
        - Building on your experience 
    - Ability to listen

Notes:
- No courses "listening" at school 
- Very important


VVVVV
## Source of power 

- BATNA
- Should we disclose our BATNA ? 
    - If weak alternative : NO 
    - If strong alternative : YES

VVVVV
## Example - Ford

- Ford negotiate with a supplier 
    - Directly tell their BATNA 
        - Want to cut your cost 
        - If not possible we have 5 others waiting


VVVVV
## Example - Ford

- Response from supplier could be : 
    - It's been x years 
    - Always on time 
    - Good quality 
    - R&D followed by us

VVVVV
## Strategy

- BATNA 
    - How powerful are they ? (find their BATNA)
    - Weaken their power (their BATNA)
    - Improve your power (your BATNA)

VVVVV
## Strategy

- But BATNA does not work all the time
    - Coalition (50%-30%-20%)
        - Need trust

VVVVV
## Conclusion 

- Understand, experience the business
- Ask a lot of question 
    - Listen 
    - Avoid your favourite topic
    - Trust from the other side 
- BATNA

# Psychological tools

VVVVV
##  Heuristics 
- Simplify the negotiation 
    - i.e. : Recruits only people from top 10 universities 

Notes:
- Pre-screened to get the best 
- But another one could have better experiences and not there


VVVVV
## Tricks and Traps - Plan

- Mythical fixed pie assumption 
- Anchoring
- Overconfidence 
- Framing
- Availability 
- Escalation 
- Reciprocation
- Contrast principle 
- Big-picture perspective 


<!-- VVVVV-->
>>>>>
## Mythical fixed pie assumption  

- "Assuming that there is a conflict of interests"
- Example :
    - Arm wrestling match result
    - They juste wanted to score a lot
    - Not a competition, not a competitor 

Notes:
- Goal : score the most 
- Assume it's a competion 
    - Try to beat the other side
- Assume it's a partership 
    - Try to score the most


VVVVV
## Mythical fixed pie assumption  

- Called reactive devaluaiton 
    - ex: arm reduction proposal 
        - USA president 
        - Gorbatchev 

Notes:
- Try to devaluate the proposal of the other because of "competition"


<!-- VVVVV-->
>>>>>
## Anchoring

- "Anchor on an initial value when estimating the value of uncertain objects"

Notes:
- Src : https://miro.medium.com/max/300/1*8QVwnNYqtCvcCfWGHKRXRA.png


VVVVV
## Anchoring - Example

-  Experiment with doctors 
    - Probability of lung diseases

Notes:
- Lung disease 
    - Lower or greater than : random number 
    -  Always around this number 


<!-- VVVVV-->

## Overconfidence

- Exercice

VVVVV
## Overconfidence

    - If good at short-term decision 
    - Often bad at long term


VVVVV
## Consequences - con't

- Negotiation 
    - ZOPA (Zone of potential agreement)
        - Zone is too narrow
- Can be good to 
    - Persuade people to make more`

### Chinese overconfidence and Americain illusion

- New York, February 6, 2013 video about:
	- **Chinese** mistakes of 2010 due to **overconfidence**
	- **American** illusion/arrogance
- Singapore's veteran diplomat Kishore Mahbubani

Notes:
Before watching the video : I have absolute zero knowledge in business/politic/finance, so I don't know if this person is saying the truth or not:

### Chinese overconfidence
- China **broke off military-to-military talks** after the Obama administration’s long-expected sale of defensive arms to Taiwan,
- A high **American** official asked his **Chinese** counterpart **why China reacted so strongly to something it had accepted in the past**. 

The answer: ‘**Because we were weak then and now we are strong.**’

### Chinese overconfidence mistakes 
“*China’s new assertiveness affected its relations with others besides the United States.*”

- “*Its policies in the South China Sea created fear among countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and,*”
- “*its overreaction to Japan’s actions after a ship collision near the disputed Senkaku islands led Tokyo to reaffirm its alliance with Washington.*”

### American illusion

- Americans unable to admit the truth 
    - <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/PPPSH@WEO/USA/CHN/EUQ" target="_blank" > GDP based on PPP, share of world</a>
- To my understanding 
	- “““Kind of **American** culture to see themselves like **are** the **best in the universe**”””
	
** Insert America meme here **

Notes:
Overconfidence example not so clear so I found a short clip more about overconfidence itself in context of job interview

→ Dunning-Kreger effect?

VVVVV
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #c32c2c" -->
### Avoid overconfidence 
### Avoid Dunning-Kruger effect

- Always Be **Learning** → get **competent**
- Beware **Beginnings** → when you **know the less**
- **Slow Down** →  fast decisions are generally more biased decisions
	- Ask yourself **what could be wrong**
- Know **When** to **Be Confident** → i.e. “a general on the day of battle.”


Notes:
- **Based on a AMA of David Dunning**
- Beware Beginnings: it's most likely to hit when beginning: example of **buying a car → make some research**
- Slow Down : do not jump to conclusions 
	- Ask yourself what could be wrong

## Framing

- "The way that options are framed cause us averse to risk"    
- Positive choice 
    - Going to the sure thing
- Negative choice  
    - Going to the unsure thing 

VVVVV
## Example

- Warning the way the choices are framed 
    - Same choice can be formulated differently 
        - 200/600 people will be saved 
        - 400/600 people will die 

VVVVV
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #c32c2c" -->
### Framing effect

### Framing effect 2 cont'

- Framing ? → **Default effect**
	- Experiments and observational studies show that making an **option a default increases** the **likelihood that it is chosen**; this is called the default effect”
- It's easier for us to pick the default choice

## Availability 

- "We are influenced by information that is most easily available"
- We are more exposed to certain information than other
    - Dramatic videos are more easily retained 

VVVVV
## Example
- What is the Tragic incident with the higer death per year ? 
    - Motor accident 
    - Lung cancer 

VVVVV
## Example - Answer

- Motor accident : 34.000/year

Notes:
- Begin with share food, tools ...
- Src : http://img.youtube.com/vi/oy_wU0NpzVY/0.jpg
 

VVVVV
## Example

- Offer a gift to someone not interested 
- Give information about something
- At the end we give back something ... 

<!-- VVVVV-->
>>>>>
## Contrast principle 

- "Things look different when presented in sequence"

    - To void traps and being lost in the details

VVVVV
## Conclusion 

- Always keep in mind the traps 
- Always think if it is not a trick used to sell
