- Human Reliance on single feature of available data & Shortcuts
	- Shortcuts: A consequence of the era of "Information overload"
- Protecting us against attack on our system of shortcuts
- Conclusion

NDLR: I would call this "table of content" instead of key points. "Key points" usually refers to "key points to remember" ... but "conclusion" hardly qualifies as a "key points". It's often the title of the key points section though.

>>>>>
### Our goals and objectives 
- Show human shortcuts are result of our fast-paced day & complex world

- Understand the  moral obligation to rebel and push back on any attempt to trick us with influence shortcuts

>>>>>
###  Single Feature Of Available Data's Human Reliance
- The John Pine TV talk show story
Notes:
    Two key points to understand here:
        - Available data 
        -  Single features
VVVVV
### The John Pine TV talk show History
- Program made of John caustic and confrontational style
- Made of exposure-hungry, entertainer, celebrities, representatives of:
  - Political and social organizations

VVVVV
### John's Approach
- Provoking his guest into embarrassing admissions
- Generally Make them look foolish

Notes:
- It was not uncommon for Pine to introduce a visitor and launch immediately into attack on the individual's belief, talent or appearance

VVVVV
### About John Itself
- Legs imputed
- Correlation between his imputation and  his personality

Notes:
- Some people claimed that Pine's acid life style was partially caused by this fact 
- But some argues it is not

VVVVV
### John's Interview With Franck Zappa

- Zappa: Rock musician with very long hair
- Interview happend in the sixties
- Long hair: unusual and controversial

VVVVV
### An Excerpt of John and Zappa's Exchange

Pine:"I guess your long hair makes you a girl"
Zappa: "I guess your wooden leg makes you a table"

Notes:
- What's happend here, when Pine is referring to Zappa as a girl or trying to figure out such a description about Zappa,
- he does rely on a single piece of information which is his long hair, with stereotype characterizing man having long hair in the sixties, we should understand that this piece of information may have been enough
- NDLR: several slides for ... what is your point? was this the most efficient use of your time to make your point to the audience?

VVVVV
### A modern days Illustration of relia
NDLR: "relia" ?
- Woman wearing anklets, synonym to lesbian?
![](https://framapic.org/xrbiO6QuFBYe/n1q6lB4W1lg3)
NDLR: careful confirmation biais
NDLR: careful, first link is not phrased in a way that supports your speech. Third one maybe. As suggested by audience, maybe you should remove "lesbian" from your search to make it a better illustration

VVVVV
![](https://framapic.org/XyAjM17FXZFr/1Qa7vDlkG1Yj)

VVVVV
### What can we learn from these facts?
- The use of partial, incomplete information to make decision
- Using, only a single, highly representative piece of the total

Notes:
- Very often in making decision about someone or something, we don't use all the relevant Available information
- we use instead only a single highly representative piece of the total

VVVVV
###  The consequences?
- use of isolated piece of information:
  - May counsels us correctly
  - But can lead to mistake  
- if exploited by others, leave us looking silly or worse

VVVVV
### Example
![](https://framapic.org/ZbMNk5KSo1Ev/mxzzXdDkEmg8)
NDLR: careful, first link is not phrased in a way that supports your speech. the question "do lesbians wear anklets" itself does not mean people assume that wearing an anklets is a sign of being a lesbian.you are making. That's the "non sequitur" fallacy, isn't it?

Notes:
- source: https://www.quora.com/Do-lesbians-wear-anklets

VVVVV
### A recall to shortcut
- Our short approach is likened to automatic responding of lower animal

- Animal, behavior pattern triggered by lone stimulus Features

  - Example: The cheep-cheep sound

VVVVV
### Why infrahumans rely on solitary stimulus features ?
- Limited mental capability
- Small brain cannot register and process all relevant information 

Notes:
- Infrahuman: "A creature that is not (yet) at the level of understanding of a human being, such as a presymbolic child or an animal." infrahuman. (2019, March 14). Wiktionary, The Free Dictionary. Retrieved 15:24, November 8, 2019 from https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=infrahuman&oldid=51787733. 

VVVVV
### But do human use shortcut?
- Understanding human brain's mechanism
  - More effective than infrahumans
  - Being able to take into account a multitude or relevant facts
  - Consequently being able to make good decision
- So why do we use shortcut?

VVVVV

- Demands of the pace of modern life

- Sake of efficiency

- Retreating from time-consuming, sophisticated fully informed brand of decision making

Notes:
    - Despite of of susceptibility to stupid decisions that accompanies a reliance on a single feature of the available data, the pace of modern life demands that we frequently use shortcuts
    
    - We have created an environment  so complex, fast-paced, and information-laden that we must increasingly deal with it in the fashion  of the animals
    
    - For the sake of efficiency, we must sometimes retreat from time-consuming, sophisticated, fully informed brand of decision making to a more automatic, primitive, single-feature type of responding
    
VVVVV
### Popular prompts of human compliance
- In deciding whether to say yes or no to a requester
	- Human pays attention to one piece of relevant situation
- By employing factors such as: 
    - Reciprocation, consistency, social proof, liking, authority and scarcity

Notes: 
    - so we often we use these shortcuts  and so automatically in making our compliance decisions
    - Each by, by itself, provides a highly reliable cue to when we will be better off saying yes  than no
    
VVVVV  
### When does human use these cues? NDLR: "does human" <- spelling mistake
    - When we don't have the inclination, time, energy, or cognitive resources to undertake complete analysis of our situation
    - Where rushed, stressed, uncertain, distracted, or fatigued 
    NDLR: "where" ? or "when"?

Notes: 
    - When making decisions under these circumstances, we often revert to the rather primitive but necessary single-piece-of-good-evidence approach

###  Shortcut: A consequence era of Information overload

VVVVV
### Information Overload
- Initially  in Bertram Gross' 1964 book, The Managing of Organizations <- NDLR: missing publisher in reference, isbn, doi, etc. if available
- Further popularized by Alvin Toffler in his bestselling 1970 book Future Shock. Speier et al. (1999)<- NDLR: missing publisher in reference, isbn, doi, etc. if available
- Definition:
    -  The difficulty in understanding an issue and effectively making decisions when one has too much information about that issue (Wikipedia)
- Other Meanings:  infobesity, infoxication, information anxiety,  and information explosion
    
Notes:
- Source:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_overload <- NDLR: this is not how you cite a reference. In particular, for wikipedia, it's so easy. You have a link on your left called "Cite this page"
- Generally, the term is associated with the excessive quantity of daily information. Information overload most likely originated from information theory, which are studies in the storage, preservation, communication, compression, and extraction of information.

- " Information overload occurs when the amount of input to a system exceeds its processing capacity. Decision makers have fairly limited cognitive processing capacity. Consequently, when information overload occurs, it is likely that a reduction in decision quality will occur." source wikipedia <- NDLR: this is a very bad reference "source wikipedia" You could have written "The Internet is the biggest source of information overload, in particular, Twitter. Source: Napoléon Bonaparte" ... it looks the same. Where, when? How do we check this? this is not how you cite a reference. In particular, for wikipedia, it's so easy. You have a link on your left called "Cite this page". 


VVVVV
### Information Overload (cont')
- "We are facing with an array of choice among styles and  product that were unheard of previous hear and may well obsolete  or forgotten by next" <- NDLR: ?? quote without source?

VVVVV
### The contribution of technologies to information overload
- Avalanche of information  and choices is made possible by technologies progress
- Technologies lead to collection, storing and communicating information

- Examples of information  evolution:
    - Extensive cable and satellite television system
    - Internet (www) and social networks

	        - NDLR: why should the reader view this video? what should the viewer remember from it? how is it related/relevant for the topic at hand? insert all that information in the link pad    

VVVVV
### The consequences of information overload
- Technology evolves  very fast
- Human natural capacity to process information is likely to be increasingly inadequate

Notes: 
    - Because technology can evolve much faster than we can, our natural capacity to process information is likely to be increasingly inadequate to handle the surfeit of change, choice, and challenge that is characteristic of modern life.

VVVVV 
### The rise of shortcuts & Human created deficiency

- Dealing with the intricacy and richness of outside environment
- Consequently our deficiency is similar of the animals' long-standing one. 
- When making decision, enjoying less luxury of fully considered analysis of the total situation 
- Reverting to a focus on a single, usually reliable feature of it

Notes: 
    - More and more frequently, we will find ourselves in the position of the lower animals—with a mental apparatus that is unequipped to deal thoroughly with the intricacy and richness of the outside environment.
    - Unlike the animals, whose cognitive powers have always been relatively deficient, we have created our own deficiency by constructing a radically more complex world.
    - When making a decision, we will less frequently enjoy the luxury of a fully considered analysis of the total situation but will revert increasingly to a focus on a single, usually reliable

>>>>>
### Protecting us against attack on   our  system  of  shortcuts

VVVVV 
### Shortcut approach & automatic response, always wrong?
- When truly reliable, there is nothing wrong 

- Problems arise when being counseled poorly

Notes: before diving on techniques to protect our system of shortcut against bad exploitation we should ask ourselves the questions whether this is a bad thing at all.

VVVVV 
### Individual exploiting our shortcuts
- Compliance professional playing fairly

- Compliance  practitioners  looking for to deceive us!

Notes: 
    - Our shortcut is for sure is a gold mine  that is exploitable
    - In order to understand how we are supposed to protect our selves we need to understand who can exploit them
		- The good guy 
		- The bad guy 

VVVVV 
### What we do against intensified attack on our system of shortcuts?

- Forceful counterassault 
- Identifying our allies 
- Identifying our enemies

VVVVV 
### The social proof shortcut illustration
- According to the principle of social proof, we often decide to do what other like us are doing
- Popular action in a given situation is functional and appropriate

VVVVV 
### The social proof shortcut illustration (cont')
- Advertiser without deceptive statistic, provides information about a branded toothpaste
- This kind of information is valuable evidence of the quality of the product
- We might want to rely on a single peace of information, popularity, to decide
- Conserving us cognitive energies 

Notes: 
    use of celebrity in advertisement
    ? http://humourous.free.fr/citations/citations.php?id=3&author=jean-claude-vandamme

VVVVV
### The story from a different angle
- Compliance practitioner simulating shortcut response by giving fraudulent signal for it 
- Constructing staging unrehearsed-interview commercials 

Notes: 
	The story becomes quite different, however, should a compliance practitioner try to stimulate a shortcut response by giving us a fraudulent signal for it. The enemy is the advertiser who seeks to create an image of popularity for a brand of toothpaste by, say, constructing a series of staged “unrehearsed-interview” commercials in which an array of actors posing as ordinary citizens praise the product. Here, where the evidence of popularity is counterfeit, we, the principle of social proof, and our shortcut response to it, are all being exploited

VVVVV
### Amazon fake reviews case 
- Reviews on e-commerce platform, powerful tool to influence visitors's choice

NDLR:
    - any feedback on https://www.fakespot.com/
	    - https://lifehacker.com/how-to-spot-fake-reviews-on-amazon-1834561279
    - "visitors' " instead of "visitors's"

- Problem ?
	- Regular buyers  leaves few reviews, More kin to leave negative reviews
	
- Common sellers' practice? 
	- Staging their reviews by using various techniques such incentivized review

VVVVV
### Aggressive  stance against abusive shortcuts exploiters
- Turn them your back and Refuse 
- Use of boycott, threat,  confrontation, censure, tirade to retaliate
- Examples:
    - Do not watch a TV programs using canned laughter
    - Give nothing to a bartender salting his tip jar
    - Avoid a club staging its popularity

>>>>>
# Conclusion
- People tends to use shortcuts an rely on single piece of information when making decision 
- Human being develop shortcut as a results as today complex and fast-paced world
- Bad compliance practitioners will look to exploit our shortcut
- We need to retaliate or walk away against abusive use of our system of shortcut
