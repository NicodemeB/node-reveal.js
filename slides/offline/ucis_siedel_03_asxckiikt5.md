# Perspectives on Contracts


VVVVV
## Intro 

"Negotiation takes place in the shadow of the law." :

1. Dispute resolution (litigation as the BATNA + DT)
2. **Deal making (legal framework for contract negotiation)**

Notes:
- Best Alternative To a Negociated Agreement
- Presentation on deal making part


VVVVV
## Contract definition
"A contract is an agreement, enforceable by law."

Two key elements : 

- agreement 
- enforceable by law

VVVVV
## Example 

*We can agree about the weather but that's not enforceable by law.*

This is not enforceable by law.

The **goal** is an agreement that will be held up in a court of law.

VVVVV
## Perspectives

- Global perspective 
- Business perspective
- Private perspective

VVVVV
## Global perspective

*"setting up “market systems” in former communist lands, one thing should be kept in mind: It cannot be done without first creating a legal system that protects the right of all individuals to hold, buy and sell property and without the legal protections for the contracts through which those transactions are conducted.... [A] * **system of contract law and the means to enforce it are fundamental."**
George Melloan, Wall Street Journal

Contracts must be reliable and honored by courts otherwise there is a risk when making investments.

VVVVV
## Business perspective

*"Obtaining a contract is the primary goal of a business" *

*Legal Responsibilities of Managers*

Contracts are the cores of any business entity, without these contracts, the entity would not exist.

Contracting is where value creation takes place.

VVVVV
## Personal perspective

*"In the world of contracts you as the writer control the script and produce the play."*

*How to Keep Your Company Out of Court*

Day to day life example : 

- Walking to a McDonald's and buy a hamburger,
- Contracts that relate to us personality : buying a house,
- Could relate to our personal work : contracts made on behalf of our business.

VVVVV
## Conclusion

Regardless where we make the contracts : we exercise freedom of contract : we create our responsibilities and our duties.

# Sources of Contract Law : Two Variables

VVVVV
## Var 1 : type of Legal System

- Common Law : developed in England originally
    - Based on **precedence** : In addition to law made by legislatures, to constitutions, rules by administrative agencies, courts look at prior decisions to decide particular cases,

- Civil Law : originated on the European continent
    - Based on a **code** : encyclopedia of law,

VVVVV
## Practical difference 

In many cases, the laws of the two countries overlap.

- Common Law
    - More **scenarios must be considered**

- Civil Law 
    - Short : **much longer** than in the past but shorter than common law

Situations where variance in law, but in most cases the two systems overlap.

VVVVV
## Examples of countries 

Civil law countries (based on European law):

- Brazil
- US : Louisiana bought from France : civil law tradition
- Canada : Quebec : civil law tradition

Common law countries (countries once "owned" by England):

- India
- US : initially owned by England
- Canada : most of provinces are common law

VVVVV
## Var 2 : What type of contracts ? 

Depends on the origin of the contract : 

- Services : Common law or Civil law depending on the geography
- Real estate : Common law or Civil law depending on the geography
- Products or "Goods" : Uniform laws based on Uniform Commercial Code ; UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods

VVVVV
## UN Convention on Contracts

81 countries have adopted the UN convention on contracts : including Belgium.

Example : selling goods from a company from Brazil to the US : contract governed by these international laws.

# Key Elements in Creating Contracts

VVVVV
## Key elements 

1. Is there an agreement?
2. Is there consideration?
3. Is the agreement legal?
4. Must the deal be in writing?

>>>>>
# 1. Is there an agreement?

VVVVV
## Intro

Answering this question can be common sense : 

- Did one side make an offer ?
- Did the other side accept the offer ? 

VVVVV
## Example 

Context : Store wans to buy TVs to the Manufacturer 

- Monday : Store ;  offers to buy TVs ; delivery to the store
- Wednesday : Manufacturer ; Accept offer, but store to pick up at the plant
- Friday : store says ok

Is there a contract ? If so when ? 

Yes, there is a contract, based on acceptance of the store after the counter offer of the manufacturer

VVVVV
## Counter offer

A counter offer kills the original offer. Accepting the initial offer and adding additional terms, is a counter offer. So the original offer can no longer be accepted.

VVVVV
## Example 

- College offers a job to professor
- She replies by email: “Granting some of the following provisions would make my decision easier.... Let me know what you think.”
- Examples of the provisions: a higher salary, “no more than three new class preparations per year for the first three years”
- College search committee replied: We have “decided to withdraw (the) offer of employment to you.”

Flaherty, “Negotiated Out of a Job,” Inside Higher Ed

VVVVV
## Example cont'

There would not be any contract if she accepted the initial offer after receiving the last communication because : 

1. They withdraw the offer,
2. A court could have easily considered her words as a counter offer (her words were ambiguous)

VVVVV
## Convert a deal to a contract

Can be done using a "framework agreement" ;

- Skeleton agreement, 
- Then gradually fill the missing pieces

VVVVV
## Framework Agreements 

Examples of framework agreements (great negotiation tools):

- Preprinted Lease or Real Estate Contract 
- Memorandum of Understanding
- Letter of Intent
- Agreement in Principle
- Memorandum of Agreement 

VVVVV
## Line crossed 

When the framework agreement is completed, a line is crossed from negotiating tool to a binding contract.

VVVVV
## Example 

- Two companies have a "Memorandum of Agreement" (considered as a biding contract),
- Then a third party company (Texaco) arrived and bought the second company (Getty Oil) supposed to buy the first one (Pennzoil),
- The third party company (Texaco) is sued and has to pay $10.5 billion damages because it interfered is the biding contract,
- The third party company (Texaco) declared bankruptcy.

Miss-understanding can lead to a huge loss. (Texaco paid $3 billion)

VVVVV
## Conclusion 

To avoid Framework Agreements to be considered as a contract, simply write at the top that this is only a negotiation tool and is not intended as a binding contract until you agree that it is a contract.

>>>>>
# 2. Is there consideration?

VVVVV
## Definition 

"For a deal to be biding, both sides have to give up something."

- Civil law countries : consideration is not necessary,
- Common law countries : consideration is necessary
 
But probably a wise thing to try to include consideration in contracts event if it is not necessary.

VVVVV
## Example Donation

A graduate wants to make a gift to the university of $30M. Because of the taxes involved etc, the deal is that the graduate promised to pay $1.5M per year of university invoices during 20 years. 

VVVVV
## Donation cont'

But what about the death of the generous donor ? Does his children have to respect the deal made ? It depends on whether there is consideration on both sides. In this example, both sides give up something;

- The donor gave up $30M,
- The University promised to create an institute with the name of the graduate and furnish the rooms, etc 

So in this case, the promise would be enforceable event if the children did not want to perform the contract, it would be a legally binding contract because there was consideration on both sides. 

>>>>>
# 3. Is the agreement legal?

VVVVV
## Example Cocaine 

Is there is an agreement on a truckload of cocaine and a side does not deliver, and the other sues the first one in court. The question is "is this a legal contract ?" : of course not.

Cannot be enforced by the court because it is not legal + you will be arrested because of the cocaine trafficking.

VVVVV
## NCA
<!-- NON COMPETE AGREEMENT -->

In business,  Non Compete Agreements are used to make sure employees do not 'steal' clients of the company by leaving the company with its clients. These agreements can for example prevent the employee to work on the same area outside the company for a period of time, for example 1 year. 

Are these NCA legal ? Generally these agreements are legal, but the court can decide that they are not if they are too broad (in terms of geographical areas, or interest involved for example). Is the agreement is not reasonable, the court can also throw it out.

In certain states like California, NCA are illegal and unenforceable.


>>>>>
# 4. Must the deal be in writing?

VVVVV
## Intro

Is the agreement in writing ? 

- YES
- NO
    - Is writing required ?
    - Practical approach 

VVVVV
## Written agrmnt
Example : 

- We live in India, 
- We have an offer to work in NYC,
- We discuss the details of the contract, we'd like the company to cover the bill of sending our furniture to NYC, we found an agreement (the company promise to pay for the furniture travel bill), but we forgot to put the furniture agreement into the contract,
- When we arrived we ask the company to pay for the bill 

Is the company legally forced to pay that bill ? 

VVVVV
## W.A. cont'

Is the company legally forced to pay that bill ? 

No, when there is a written contract, the court will base its decision only on the written contract/agreement.

This is the **Parol Agreement Rule**.

The rule is generally included as a separated clause in virtually every business contract.

VVVVV
## W.A. cont'

Back to the initial example, if you remembered that you forgot to include the repayment of the bill for the furniture in the contract, then send an email to the company explaining the situation, the company then agrees to pay that bill but does not.

Is it suable ? No, due to consideration, the company gave up something but you did not (the fact of working for them is not part of the consideration because you already have a previous contract for that).


VVVVV
## Oral agreement 

Are oral agreement enforceable ? Yes, even is they are multi-millions agreements. However, each country has exceptions.

Certain contracts are so important that they must be written.

For example, real estate contracts, in virtually every country, must be written to be enforceable.

**Despite the technicalities of the law, in a practical matter, it is better to always put agreements in a written contract.**

Written words are better the memories.

*"The palest ink is better than the best memory."*
Chinese proverb

VVVVV
## Express contracts 

Contracts do no need to be 20 pages long to be receivable by a court as valid contract as long as it is written. Event a contract on a restaurant napkin is acceptable.

VVVVV
## Example

Contract concerning a farm sold for $50K on a restaurant order signed by both parties(after a few drinks).

*"We hereby agree to sell to W.O. Lucy the Ferguson Farm complete for $50,000.00, title satisfactory to buyer."* 

The next day, the owner of the farm retracts. 

The court received the restaurant order as a valid contract and the owner of the farm had to transfer the ownership for the price on the contract.

This an example of express contract.

VVVVV
## Contract terms

- Express
- Implied

In express contract, the law automatically includes terms in that contract. 

VVVVV
## Example

X : client, Y : store's owner,

- X buys chips in Y's store,
- The chips are spoiled (but sold within the expiration date),
- X became seriously ill (because of the spoiled chips and only because of this),
- X sues Y for breach of warranty,

There is a standard sale contract (not negotiated), commodity contracts between X and Y.

Considering that the chips were correctly conserved and not tampered, is Y liable ?

VVVVV
## Example cont'

Considering that the chips were correctly conserved and not tampered, is Y liable ? 

Yes, Y is liable, because there is an implied warranty that the chips are of fair, average, ordinary quality. Even is there is no contract, the law will imply that the goods have to be of good quality.

>>>>>
# Business vs. Legal Objectives

VVVVV
## Tensions 

There is a tension between business and legal objectives. This is due to the inherent definition of a contract: 

"A contract is (1) an agreement (2) enforceable by law."

- The 'agreement' part relates to business deals, 
- The 'enforceable by law' part relates to the aspect of a contract.

The contract tension is directly between : 

- Loss prevention : Legally perfect contract ,
- Value creation : Achieve your business goals 


VVVVV
## 2 Questions 

1. How can we refocus contracts so that business objectives do not become lost in the legalities?
2. How can we make the legal terms more understandable?


VVVVV
## Q1 : Refocus contracts

VVVVV
## 'Perfect contract'

Conventional goal: An agreement that is “final, binding and enforceable. The contract documents should, thus, be [legally] as ‘perfect’ as possible.”

Pohjonen and Visuri in A Proactive Approach to Contracting and Law (2008)

Legally perfect contract from a layer point of view: 

- They're asking what happens if **something goes wrong.**
- What happens if we **end up in court?**
- Will the promises made by the other side be **enforceable**?


VVVVV
## Issues
- **Length and complexity**: Handshake deal can morph into 40+ page contract
- Transaction **Costs**: Time and expense of working with lawyers when drafting and later when interpreting the contract
- Contract becomes the focal point when **future disagreements arise**, rather than business problem solving
- Cross-cultural concerns when negotiating in cultures where relationships more important than formal contracts
- **Focus on negatives** rather than on **positive business opportunities**. See Weatherly, “Pathclearer,” 

PLC Law Department Quarterly, Oct-Dec. 2005

VVVVV
## Alternative

### A Scottish “Lean Contracting” Approach

**Contracts should emphasize free market economics rather than legalities.** Minimalist approach where contracts include:

- Goods or services and their price
- Intellectual Property Rights
- Terms implied by law but not written into the contract
 See Weatherly, “Pathclearer,” PLC Law Department Quarterly, Oct-Dec. 2005

VVVVV
## Example 

“We have therefore agreed upon the essential elements of our contract. Rather than incur time and expense negotiating and recording in writing other non-essential terms and conditions of our contract, we have agreed to allow the general law to regulate such matters, implying such terms as it may.”

Template - Pathclearer supply agreement (Clause 5) http://ld.practicallaw.com/0-201-3576

VVVVV
## Example 

“There is no minimum duration for this agreement. **We will simply continue to do business with each other for so long as it remains mutually beneficial to do so.** ...”

Template - Pathclearer supply agreement (Clause 4) http://ld.practicallaw.com/0-201-3576


- Why treat the contract as a club, a legal club, to force the other side to do something they don't want to?
- Why not use this free market economics approach if it doesn't make sense to continue doing business together then, walk away.

VVVVV
## Comparison

- Beer company and bottle supplier : 23 pages + 8 exhibits
- Scottish company with supplier : 1 page + 1 attachment 

However, this approach can be interesting in some situations but not in every situation: 

- b2b agreements;
    - "One-time" transactions (loan agreements, share, transaction, etc.) : more detailed contract,
    - Long-term relationship; certain trust in the other party
        - Minimal Legal terms
        - "Commercial Affinity" : say 'together' as long as it makes sense

VVVVV
## Layers reactions 

Layers claims that contract should be +40 pages to be a perfect contract, but their own contracts with their client are basically a handshake, an agreement and often not even a written contract or at most a one-page agreement.

VVVVV
## Example 

Warren Buffet and Wal-Mart (Chapter 1.11) : a handshake saved time and millions of dollars when buying a $23M Wal-Mart company because of **trust** in Wal-Mart.

**Trust** can be more beneficial and cost efficient than +40 pages contracts.

VVVVV
## 2 Questions 

1. How can we refocus contracts so that business objectives do not become lost in the legalities?
2. How can we make the legal terms more understandable?

VVVVV
## Q2 : Legal terms 

Visualization is easier to understand than a compact text.

VVVVV
## Example 

This Agreement shall be valid for an initial period of three (3) years from the date of signing. Unless either Party gives notice of termination at least six (6) months before the expiry of the three-year period, it shall remain in force until further notice, with a notice period of at least three (3) months. Notice shall be given in writing.
