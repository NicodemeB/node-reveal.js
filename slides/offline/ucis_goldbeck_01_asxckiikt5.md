VVVVV
###  Issue with within the doctor system

- General considerations
	- Security and user experience should be co-developed
	
	- Start thinking of security and user computer system interaction from  the beginning

	- The mechanism of psychological acceptance may not always work

Notes:
        - There should be a certain trade off between computer system usability and security
        system not designed with users in mind  may have their security by passed by users

- One of the principles of system security is the mechanism of psychological acceptance,
  when you try to persuade people to accept certain security measures even if they are counter productive

- There should be a certain  measure at which extend such as a mechanism can be applied and used

VVVVV
###  Meaning of Usability for computer system security
- Usability for computer security is about:
	- Understanding basics of  user computer interactions
	- Understanding of human's cognitive and psychologist abilities
	- How do people's task and what they are trying to do
	- Looking at method to design these facts into the system & evaluating how it does;

>>>>>
## Human-Computer interaction

VVVVV
### Human-Computer interaction
- Human-computer interaction  or HCI, is the study of how people interact with technology

![](https://framapic.org/rFrL5lmmDYus/APoYjHVdM1BR)

VVVVV
### Human-Computer interaction
- Users may include:
    - Non-mobile workers working with computers
    - Mobile workers

- In HCI is about understanding the people, the technology and how they fit together

VVVVV
### HCI from user's perspective
- It is interesting to understanding both the psychological and cognitive abilities of  users

- The fallout
  - Designing technology that take advantage of people's interabilities

  - Avoiding over-tasking people by requiring them to do things they are not capable of

Notes:
- On over-tasking people
    - Technology should not be designed even for security reason to make people's work
    painful, difficult, otherwise this can result in having people bypassing the security
    measures for convenience.
    Good design should not extra, and unnecessary work for users

VVVVV
### HCI from technology perspective
- HCI allows to apprehend both design and evaluations of technology

- Technology is designed according to first-hand knowledge

VVVVV
## Users, Tasks & Context
- Users
  - Anyone from children to adult
  - People working alone or people working in group
- Task
  - Things that are people are trying to accomplish within the system such:
      - Login in, analyzing of data set so and so
- Context

VVVVV
## Why do they matter?
- Users, tasks and context's understanding is critical to good design practice
- Allowing to build technology that takes into considerations our knowledge about users, their task and context
- Resulting in building user-friend lytechnology system

VVVVV
## HCI: Evaluation
- Different than security evaluation
	- The goal here is not to evaluate the security of a system
	- But rather evaluating  system user-friend lyapproach

>>>>>
## Usability

VVVVV
## Measuring usability
Factors to be considered when measuring usability:
  - **Speed**: How quickly can the task be accomplished
  - **Efficiency**: How many mistakes are made in accomplishing the tasks
  - **Learnability**: How easy is it to learn to use the system
  - **Memorability**: Once learned, how easy it is to remember how to use the system
  - **User preference**: it's about what the users like the most

Notes:
- A good system design may not include all of these metrics in order to have good usability, there may be a trade off somehow.

- Illustration:
        login to iPhone using password vs using touch ID

VVVVV
### How do we measure these metrics?
- Speed - timing
- Efficiency - counting errors

VVVVV
### Learnability measurement
![](https://framapic.org/uctPCPkJ9RYW/oBs8RyVZxUf3)

Notes:
Learning curve

VVVVV
### Memorability Measurement
![](https://framapic.org/y4x6ikr7rlEF/Wj6bRpkrvfrI)

Notes:
"Bad" memorable system 

VVVVV
![](https://framapic.org/1clQOEoeN18X/o0SFUmoIgftX)

Notes:
"Good" memorable system 

VVVVV
## Tasks & Task analysis
- **Analyzing** the Usability of a system **requires** a set of **task**
- Tasks are goals that users set out to accomplish in a system

VVVVV
### Common errors in task creation
- **Leading** or **too descriptive**
- Specific questions
  - Example: what is the third headline on ccn.com?
- Directing users towards things you want to tell  them, not what they want to know

VVVVV
### Comparing tasks between systems
- To evaluate the usability of a system we can create a representative list of task
- Evaluate the usability  of these tasks
- The illustration of file creation

Notes:
Leading and too descriptive:
- Click on the username box at the upper  right of the screen and enter your username,
  then click on the password box underneath it and enter your password. Click submit
- specific questions

Tasks are too abstract to apprehend at first hand,
in order to test the usability of a system we need to create a set of tasks,
come up with a specific goal that users want to accomplish and analyzing the usability of those goals.
This will give a deep understanding about the system such where it sucks and work it  works

>>>>>
## Chunking Information

VVVVV
![](https://framapic.org/YO5UsIA3VUNc/3HZd0oNrNsTr)
- Human brain has limitations in memory
- Understanding this in a cognitive perspective, allow the design of the system that can take advantage of human capabilities

VVVVV
### Working memory
- Also called short-term memory
- The part of system of interest when building system
- People can remember 7+/-2 things at the same (Georges A. Miller 1956)
- broadcast (1975): 4-6
- Le Compte(1999): 3
- Common practice:4+/-1

Notes: if we design system we can keep in mind best solution

VVVVV
### Chunking:
- The mechanism of chuncking  helps understanding working memory

VVVVV
### Chunking: example 1
- oomgydliev
- old veg mi yo
- video gym lo
- I love my dog

VVVVV
### Chunking: Example 2
![](https://framapic.org/fpzOV2KDvuYD/QtbarksDHpuU)

VVVVV
### The issue with passwords
- To easy password (vulnerable to brute force or dictionary attack)

- Complicated password rule may result into security issues

VVVVV
### Password Memory
- Create password with chunks
  Password creation can take advantage of the chunking memory
- Example: 08#11#71Lg12#11#81kd

- As per research result;
	- 50% of people will remember a 7-character password
	- While 76% do remember 4-chunk password

Notes: Picking up two dates
date items delimited by special characters the followed by some initial
refering to LeCompte or Georges A miller theory this may be hard to memorize since it's 10 characters.

>>>>>
## Mental Model

VVVVV
![](https://framapic.org/TOcIG7xJlPmh/Ycx9Sz9uqpaJ)

VVVVV
### What is it about?
- An explanation of someone's thought process about how something works in the real world. [1]
- A representation of the surrounding world, the relationships between its various parts
  and a person's intuitive perception about his or her own acts and their consequences. [1]
- It's an important part of Usability

VVVVV
### The use of previous experience
- To using a new system users do rely on mental model based:
	- On previous experiences
	- Previous system that they have been using

Notes: 
user

VVVVV
### Mental Model Development
Factors playing into the development of mental model
- Affordance: Things that happen in a system showing users how they are supposed to be used        
- Constraint: Preventing doing things that should not be done in a system
- Conventions: Common understanding of what something means

Notes:
Convention can be cultural or universal

VVVVV
## Affordance
- Mapping
- Visibility 
- Feedback

VVVVV
### Affordance: Mapping
Describing how functionalities matching something that you need

# Measuring usability 

Notes:

VVVVV
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #456789" -->

## Introduction to gaze tracking

- Early days:
 - 1800s: early studies 
 - 1879: ophthalmologist Louis Émile Javal
- 1980s: human-computer-interaction
- 1990s and beyond: usability 


Notes: 

eye tracker
read first

usability method but not only 
visual system, psychology, in psycholinguistics, marketing, as an input device for human-computer interaction, product design, rehabilitative applications

Javal: - Reading series of short stops and quick saccades

some evolution follows: less intrusive eye tracking, way to look deepens on task

1980s : 
 - How users search for commands in computer menus
 - Use eye-tracking results in real time to help disabled users <- Which is what we are going to compare in the second study
1990's: Benel, Ottens & Horst, 1991: studied people looking at webpages


VVVVV
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #456789" -->

## Introduction to Think aloud (TA) 

- Usability method 
- Two types:
 - Concurrent Think aloud (CTA)
   - Speaking concurrently effect users’ task performance
   - Lessen the attention and concentration
   - Verbalize the steps change the steps followed
 - Retrospective Think aloud (RTA) 

Notes: 
CTA: users work on typical tasks while at the same time verbalizing what they are thinking and doing
-> we saw it in videos
 - speaking concurrently may have a negative effect on users’ task performance
 - .
 - the effort to fully verbalize the steps in the work might change the ways that users attend to the task components 

RTA: collects the verbalization of a user’s performance after the performance is over
-> we will see a study that test it's validity

VVVVV
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #456789" -->

## The Validity of the Stimulated Retrospective Think-Aloud Method as Measured by Eye Tracking 
-  University of Washington
- Investigate the validity and reliability of RTA
- By comparing subjects’ verbalizations with their eye movements

Notes: 

VVVVV
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #456789" -->

## Two Hypothesis and two questions

- RTA describes the same __sequence__ of objects in the same __order__ that the subject attended to in the original task performance
- Not __affected by the task complexity__, which is defined in terms of visual information processing complexity
- What __additional information__ RTA is able to provide?
- What __information__ are __missed__ by RTA

Notes: 

VVVVV
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #456789" -->

## Experiment

- __Experimental tasks__ instead of real world tasks 
- Simple task
 - Number pattern: indentify last number in a sequence
 - Puzzle: choose piece that is lacking
- Group task 
 - Classroom data table
 - Bottle or airplane graph (graphical)
 
Notes:

 complex:
 - difference between room capacity and number of students to determine maximum overload 
 - use and retain information about two airplanes from three separate graphs
 
VVVVV
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #456789" -->

## Experiment
 
- Four sections: 
 - Pre-questionnaire
 - Task performance session
 - RTA session
 - Post-questionnaire
- Forty-three student volunteers undergraduate engineering class 

Notes:
    
pre-questionnaire asked about subjects’ background and experience in eye tracking and in using the think aloud method

RTA: 
- train to do rta 
- asked to do it while watching a video of them doing stuff without the glaze

Post-questionnaire: about their perceptions of task complexity and their experience in doing RTA. 

VVVVV
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #456789" -->

## Results: distinction two levels 

![coerce vs fine level](https://framapic.org/ZWrHy3xzDkzp/qFtaKjUDHCQx.PNG)

Notes:
 Coarse-level areas of Interest: major screen regions (e.g., instruction, task problem, answer choice, task submission button) 
 
 fine-level areas of Interest: further decomposed
 
VVVVV
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #456789" -->

## Results: validity

![validity results](https://framapic.org/hdozTGDTnSLj/HhzaJL9k6h6s.PNG)

Notes: 
    
- Coarse:
  - 88% valid accounts (verbal AOIs matched eye movement AOIs and occurred in the same order)
  
  - 9% of misstatements (awareness of having attended to AOI regions but inability to identify the exact target objects)
  
  - 3% fabrication in which verbal AOIs did not correspond with eye movement AOIs.
  
- Fine:
  - 53% valid accounts
  - 28% of approximate matches (identified coarse but not fine)
  - 15% misstatements (haven't identified proper coarse)  
  - 4% fabrication

VVVVV
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #456789" -->

## Results: reliability

![reliability results](https://framapic.org/WNqKfpQt36Se/KGOcYAaMJS4f.PNG)

Notes: 

- no significant difference between simple and complex tasks on the validity of RTA

- Interesting trends: subjects tended to produce more valid accounts and commit fewer fabrications in the complex tasks than in the simple tasks. 

- Suggests that subjects put more thought in complex problem-solving and can therefore verbalize in more detail

I skip Verbal Reports: Procedural, Inferential, and Explanatory 

VVVVV
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #456789" -->

## Conclusion

- Retrospective Think aloud (RTA) is a valid methodology
- Validity doesn't vary with complexity
- More information is provided for a complex task

### A Comparative Usability Study of Two Japanese Gaze Typing Systems

- Tokyo Institute of Technology, IT-University of Copenhagen
- GazeTalk: hierarchical typing interface
- Dasher: text entry is done by continuous navigation
- Goal: _"investigate, if performance indices normally used for evaluation of typing systems, such as characters per minute(CPM) and error-rate, could differentiate between the conditions"_
Notes: 
there are two versions of the gaze talk

VVVVV
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #456789" -->

### GazeTalk:  S vs CT

Notes:
    
To evaluate usability
    
Learnability was evaluated looking at the improvement in typing speed during the experiment

VVVVV
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #456789" -->

## The experiment 

- Fifteen Japanese students (19-25 yo) split into 3 groups
- Phrases and short sentences of daily conversation


Notes: 
groups: S-GazeTalk, C-GazeTalk, or Dasher

preliminary test with another Japanese gaze-typing system, Hearty Ladder -> estimate initial skill and try to have similar skilled groups

Notes: 
Anova = l'analyse de la variance in french

blocks (X axis): defined steps of the experiment 

A significant learning effect was also observed between the seven blocks.

The typing speed increased with each block for each system.

Notes:
    
Shows estimated CPM of the best-learned subject – the one having the greatest learning factor – from each typing-system group at the time of the 7th, 10th, 20th, or 50th block (one block includes 300 characters). 

The typing speed of the best Dasher subject was estimated to catch up with that of the best S-GazeTalk user at approximately 34 CPM 

VVVVV
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #456789" -->

### Results:  Typing errors (Efficiency)

![](https://framapic.org/R8vwMdjZ9rCN/AvyEtTWTVxsT.PNG)

Notes:

the rate of backspacing with Dasher was significantly far higher than with each version of GazeTalk

There was no significant difference between the two versions of Japanese GazeTalk.

VVVVV
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #456789" -->

## Results:  Subjective ratings (User preference)

![](https://framapic.org/FNsZLdgxTe94/PdGKUCcwyUIg.PNG)

Notes:
    
Differences between the typing systems and between the time instances were 20% for most items, which could be made by only a single subject’s response – as only five subjects were included in each system group.

In addition, there might have been an individual difference in the subjective criteria of rating for each item. 

Therefore, we cannot derive a sound conclusion about subjective satisfaction with each typing interface from these results.

VVVVV
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #456789" -->

## Conclusion

- Learning S-GazeTalk was slightly more efficient than the others
- Dasher was predicted to become more efficient for these users than any of the two versions of GazeTalk after some amount of practice

## Affordances and Constraints in Screen-Based Musical Instruments

- University of Sussex </br>
_"This paper describes the problems of computer music in terms of HCI and discusses our findings in relation to affordances and constraints in screen-based digital instruments."_

Notes:
We will see their definition
        course:
 - Affordances are things within a system that show a user how they're supposed to be used. (can include visibility, feedback, mapping -> stove )
 - Constraint: Preventing doing things that should not be done in a system
Talk about what it means for music 
 
 - in ixi software
 
 -ixi software is a interdisciplinary research project screen-based interface as digital musical instruments
        

VVVVV
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #456789" -->

## Definition of affordance

- J. J. Gibson _"The affordances of the environment are what it offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill"_

- Norman: perceived affordances

Notes: 
- clearer
- affordances are the properties of the relationship between the environment and the agent (human or animal)
- The relationship consists of a mapping between the properties of the environment to the potential actions of the agent
- depends on the agent -> a violin offer more action to humans than dogs

- Norman introduces the idea of perceived affordances (narrower than previous) & more interesting to us
(Norman, Donald. “Affordances, Conventions and Design” in Interactions, May-June, 1999)

VVVVV
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #456789" -->

## Broader definition of constraints (Following Norman's)

- Physical, logical and __cultural__ constraints
- _"A convention is a cultural constraint, one that has evolved over time. Conventions are not arbitrary: they evolve, they require a community of practice."_
- Musical instrument has cultural and personal constraints

Notes: 

- no longer physical only, merged with conventions! (that was separate in vids)
- ! cultural! in case of music
- mostly due to the large amount of practice of the musician, part of his body

VVVVV
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #456789" -->

## Illustration of ixi

![ixi: spin drum](https://framapic.org/8qeuSuTqGn69/9XVNMfwQI1Cd.gif)

Notes: 

"Each wheel contains from 1 to 10
pedals. The wheels rotate in various speeds, and when a
pedal hits top position (12 o’clock) it triggers the sample
or sends out OSC info to the sound engine. This allows
for the creation of complex polyrhythms. The X and Y
location of the wheels can affect parameters such as
pitch and panning."

"ixi software are new in a musical
context and deliberately have no musical reference. (such as
depicting keyboards, strings, notes, etc)"

"to get away from the cultural constraints that are
connected to the historical instruments or their parts"

VVVVV
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #456789" -->

## Affordances and constraints in ixi software

- Arbitrary mapping
- Getting away from cultural constrains
- Added complexity due to custom mapping

- Can new mental model lead to new compositional practices?

Notes: 
    
As opposed to acoustic instruments, the screen-based digital instruments are not of physical material so all mappings from a GUI element to the sound can be arbitrarily designed.

Get away from the cultural constraints 

The ixi interface is a standalone controller that sends control information to the sound engine. 
The mapping can therefore be changed to suit the needs of each musician

No "correct" way of coupling gesture and sound

People can get good at it 
But no notion of virtuosity, as used in acoustic instruments, does not have the same meaning

Each application has certain __affordances and constraints__ defined by the __behaviour__ of the __interface elements__ and their __relationship to each other__ and the __environment__ in which they exist.
environment: mapping
<- __expressive scope__

# Chunking information 

Notes:

VVVVV
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #456789" -->

## Applying the concept of chunking to tennis 

- ITF Coaching and Sport Science Review

Notes: 

Their definition of chunking has pretty much the same formulation

"Chunking involves taking individual pieces
of information and grouping them into a smaller number of
meaningful (meaningful to the user and therefore, individual
chunks will vary among individuals, dependent upon previous
experience and current use of chunking processes) larger units"
(Schmidt & Lee, 1999)

Motors learning scholars notes that
effective chunking is an important characteristic of high-level
motor skills performance (autonomous stage), such as driving a
car, reading a book or preparing a dinner for guests. Fitts and
Posner (1967) proposed that motor skill acquisition follows three
stages: a cognitive stage, associative stage, and autonomous
stage. 


VVVVV
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #456789" -->

## In Tennis: used to integrate the entire motor pattern of groundstrokes

- groundstroke elements into distinct sub-units:
 - preparation
 - forward swing
 - follow-through/recovery
- focus on fewer well-learned subunits 
- incorporated easily on complex groundstroke

Notes: 

Combining all the necessary groundstroke elements into
three distinct sub-units such as: preparation, forward swing, and
follow-through/recovery allows players to focus on fewer welllearned sub-units to be incorporated into a complex, effective
groundstroke. 

Chunking the information during life ball drills allows higher
level tennis players to make quick decisions as to which shot
they should choose and how much speed, spin and depth they
should aim for

VVVVV
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #456789" -->

## Example: The preparation phase

- anticipating the oncoming shot
- judging the trajectory
- speed and spin of the ball
- moving into an appropriate position to initiate a unit turn and stroke of the moving ball

Notes:
