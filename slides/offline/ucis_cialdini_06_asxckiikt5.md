VVVVV

## Reasons of compliance

- From the childhood we learned the rules 
	- Learned that there are sanctions if not respected 
- Recognition of legitimate authorities
	- Give us orders

Notes:
- Legitimate authorities
	- Teachers, parents, physicians, policeman, ...

VVVVV

## Reasons of compliance - Con't

- Normative Social Influence
	- Person desire to gain approval or avoid rejection
- Informative Social Influence
- Mindless conformity

Notes:
- Normative 
	- "May respect normative behaviour because there may be a severe price to pay if not respected."
- Informative
	- "New information or arguments provided in a group discussion that change a group member’s attitudes, beliefs, or behavior"
-  Mindless
	- "Using others as cues to behavior without thinking or dealing with the dilemma of perception/ thoughts and others’ perceptions and thoughts."

Notes:
- Experiment in the basement of the Stanford university
- Explain the red light 
	- If something is wrong, they switch on the red light and they stop the experiment 
- Problem : Start beating them 
	- The watcher do not stop it so it means that it is a "normal" behaviour

- “Study on memory” experiment performed by a laboratory researcher
- “Learner Role”
- “Teacher Role”

Notes:
- Subjects are volunteers
- **Learner**: have to memorize **theory** and **reply to questions** 
- **Teacher**: ask questions to the **Learner** and gives **electric punishments** if wrong answer

VVVVV
## Punishments 

- Electric shocks increasing by 15 volts
- < 75~90V: annoying but tolerable
- +90V: Learner grunt audibly
- +120V: start to hurt → Learner decides to stop
- 150V: Learner start to scream to stop
- 175V→300V: Learner can't answer correctly and punishments are not stopping 
- → 400V

Why does the Teacher (a volunteer as well) continues to deliver shocks?

VVVVV
## Why?

- One small detail: <span style="color:#3698e3">shocks were not real</span>; 
	- The Learner was a <span style="color:#3698e3">comedian</span>

VVVVV
## Real study

“When it is their job, how much <span style="color:#3698e3">suffering</span> will ordinary people be willing to <span style="color:#3698e3">inflict</span> on an entirely <span style="color:#3698e3">innocent other person</span>?”

→ About<span style="color:#3698e3"> ⅔</span> of the Teachers pulled every 30 shock switches till the last <span style="color:#3698e3">450V</span> switch

→ <span style="color:#3698e3">0/40</span> Teacher stopped when the Learner first started the demand his release

Notes:
- These results surprised everyone 
- Before the experiment, Milgram asked his colleagues, students, about % of subjects triggering the 450V trigger
	- 1 to 2 % were estimated
	- 1/1000 estimated by 39 psychiatrists 

VVVVV
### Are those results biased? 

- Sex relevant? 
	- <span style="color:#3698e3">→</span> Females  <span style="color:#3698e3">&</span> Male <span style="color:#3698e3">→</span> Same results  <span style="color:#3698e3">→</span> No
- Not aware of potential physical danger? 
	- <span style="color:#3698e3">→</span> Actor expressly announced he had heart trouble <span style="color:#3698e3">→</span> Same results  <span style="color:#3698e3">→</span> No
- Only sadists subjects?
	- <span style="color:#3698e3">→</span> Experiment announced as memory study <span style="color:#3698e3">→</span> No

“They [subjects] are you and me” [Milgram]

<span style="color:#3698e3">**→ So why are these results so high? ←**</span>
Notes:
- **Leads / possibilities**
- 
- Experiments realized to check if this observation was biased 
	- Sadists : not representative of the average citizen
		- People from all ages, sex, occupations, educational level 
		- Test on them → they're psychologically normal

VVVVV
### Milgram's theory

Results are <span style="color:#3698e3">authority related</span>

Real responsible? 

<span style="color:#3698e3">→</span> Subject's <span style="color:#3698e3">inability to defy the wishes of the boss</span> of the study; the lab-coated researcher 

Notes: 
- The researcher, if necessary, ordered the subjetcs to perform their duties - shocking the actor (despite the emotional and physical damage they were causing)

VVVVV
### M.T. - Evidences

-  <span style="color:#3698e3">Researcher directives</span>
	- Subjects would have stopped without them
- Altered versions of the experiment

Notes:
- Some subjects implored the Researcher to let them stop
	- When he refused; they continued ; with tremblements, were not so good, **nervous**, were clearly not doing it voluntarily

VVVVV
### M.T. - Evidences con't
- <span style="color:#3698e3"> Researcher stopped the experiment</span>, actor insisted on continuing <span style="color:#3698e3">→ 100%</span> subjects refused to continue

VVVVV
### M.T. - Evidences con't
- <span style="color:#3698e3"> Researcher is the victim </span>of the chocks & actor was the one giving orders <span style="color:#3698e3">→ 100%</span> subjects refused to continue

VVVVV
### M.T. - Evidences con't
-  <span style="color:#3698e3">Two 2 researchers in disagreement</span> <span style="color:#3698e3">→ 100%</span> subjects refused to continue


Notes:
- 2 researchers : subjects could not find the authority and stopped 

VVVVV
### M.T. - Con't 

“It is the extreme willingness of adults to go to almost any lengths on the command of an authority that constitutes the chief finding of the study”
	
Example of this form of authority: Governments 

Notes:
- Not fully understood → authority is a powerful tool ?

VVVVV
### Spoiler Alert

![Absolutly Barbaric](https://framapic.org/random?i=r1FOwmVaReRM/Liqi2VNPkIFM)

VVVVV
### Barbaric example

Long story short: 
    
- 1987
- 3 men attached themselves to train rails to protest 
	- They were sure the train will stop 
- Train driver received <span style="color:#3698e3">order not to stop from the Navy</span>
- Train did not stop
- 1 of the 3 men had both legs cut by the train 

Notes:
Next : Benefits of authority 

VVVVV
### Authority

- Advantage on the society
	- Allows development of sophisticated structures for : 
		- Ressource production,
		- Trade,
		- Defense, 
		- Expansion, 
		- Social control

VVVVV
### Authority con't

- We are trained from birth that:
	- Obedience to proper authority: ✅
	- Disobedience: ❌
- Bible uses authority too ✝ (Adam & Eve metaphor)

Notes:
- Not possible if no authority 
- As we talked about that, we (the people) delegate authority to the government, etc.

VVVVV
### Authority - cont'

- Authority when child (teachers, parents)
- Authority when adults (employers, judges, government leaders)

Controls rewards and punishments

<span style="color:#3698e3">→</span> Makes sense to comply with the authority 

<span style="color:#3698e3">→</span> But we also do so when it <span style="color:#3698e3">does not make any sense</span>
Notes:
- As kids, we found that talking advice from our parents and teachers was beneficial
	- Partly because they controlled our rewards and punishments 
- As adults same benefits with employers, judges, etc

VVVVV
### Automatic obedience

Comply to authority <span style="color:#3698e3">→</span> rewards <span style="color:#3698e3">→</span> easy to fall under automatic obedience

---

We don't have to think; so we don't

<span style="color:#3698e3">→</span> Can be used against us 

Notes:
- Once we realize that comply with authority is rewarding, it is easy to fall under the automatic obedience


VVVVV
### Example - Physicians - Context

- Physicians <span style="color:#3698e3">→</span> lot of health knowledge <span style="color:#3698e3">→</span> respected authority of the filed 
- Nurses obey to physician orders “naively”
- 12% daily medication error in the 1980s in hospitals
- 10% of cardiac arrests due to medication errors (Harvard University study)

Notes:
- Physicians, based on their knowledge of health, are the respected authority regarding our health
- Their **authority is then rarely questioned**
	- In hospitals, except maybe another physician, no one overrule the judgement of a physician
- Nurses do not question orders of physicians and can lead to medication errors (12% daily error rate in 1980s)
- NDLR: why do you think there is such an important cut/separation of authority between the roles? Can you see the link, parallelism in this situation and the separation of power between legislative, executive and judiciary? If you do not enforce the separation, maybe there could be a risk that one of the power plays the role of the judge, the party, the executionner, etc.
- NDLR: "The third-leading cause of death in US most doctors don’t want you to know about", Ray Sipherd, special to CNBC.com 2018-02-22 https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/22/medical-errors-third-leading-cause-of-death-in-america.html (last access 2019-11-08T15:23)
	
VVVVV
### Example - Physicians

- Prescriptions not questioned
- "Rectal earache" case :
    - Ear drops on the right ear: but instead of writing “<span style="color:#3698e3">right</span> rear”, shorted to "<span style="color:#3698e3">R</span> ear",
    - Ear drops put into patient's anus by the nurse

Notes:
- Patients, nurses, pharmacists, other physicians, do not question the prescription 

VVVVV
### Conclusion 

- Compliance professionals can use the authority principle 
- Ads with actor playing the role of a doctor in a TV show
	- Actor recommends a caffeine-free coffee brand for our own health
	- <span style="color:#3698e3">→</span> Brand sales increased
	
<span style="color:#3698e3">The actor is not a real physician and has no kownledge of health</span>

 <span style="color:#3698e3">→</span> Makes no sense at all

Notes:
- Let's move to the section on connotation, not content, were we examine this aspect of **connotation, not content**

>>>>>
## Connotation, not content

Authority principle without providing a real authority

 <span style="color:#3698e3">→</span> The  <span style="color:#3698e3">appearance</span> of the authority  <span style="color:#3698e3">is enough</span>

---

Various appearance forms:

- Titles 
- Clothes 
- Trapping 

Notes:
- If we take back the previous ad example: the appearance of an authority was enough to "fool" people
- The appearance can be of different forms :
	- Titles 
	- Clothes 
	- Trapping 


>>>>>
## Titles

- Most difficult symbol of authority to obtain normally
- Easiest for actors/con artists 

VVVVV
### Titles behavior example

- Professor talk to someone in a pub, 
- When he reveals his title, the other person completely changes his/her behavior 
	- People are not spontaneous anymore, 
	- They become respectful, accepting and dull,
	-  <span style="color:#3698e3">They agree with the professor's opinions</span>
	
Compliance practitioners can lie about a title they don't have to obtain the same effect

Notes: 
- Example with author's friend 

VVVVV
### Nurses experiment - objectives

- Find if medical errors were isolated incidents or widespread phenomenon
- In context of a serious treatment error: overprescription + unauthorized drug
- With no physical authority: a phone call by a claimed “hospital physician”

VVVVV
### Nurses experiment - context

- 22 nurses from different sections
- “physician” directed the nurse to inject 20 mg of a drug to a specific patient

VVVVV
### Reasons for the nurse to refuse : 

- Prescription transmitted by <span style="color:#3698e3"> phone</span>; in direct violation of the hospital policy,
-  <span style="color:#3698e3">Unauthorized medication</span>,
- Obvious  <span style="color:#3698e3">dangerous dosage</span> of the medication,
- Directive given by  <span style="color:#3698e3">stranger</span> (not met, seen, talked before)

Notes:
- Dosage: obviously said on the medication bottle that if was to much (max 10ml, and 20ml asked) 

VVVVV
### Nurses experiment - results 

<span style="color:red">95%</span> of nurses went to the room of the patient with the drug where a secret observant stopped them

VVVVV
### Nurses experiment - conclusions

2 professional intelligence, <span style="color:#3698e3">nurse and physician</span>, should refer to their <span style="color:#3698e3">medical training</span> to ensure the procedure is <span style="color:#3698e3">beneficial for the patient</span> (or at least non-detrimental)

The experiment strongly suggests that one intelligence (the nurse) is <span style="color:red">non-functioning</span>

Nurses automatically followed an order from what they think was authority without questioning the “authority” itself

Notes:
Now that we have seen a first symbol of authority, let's seen another : **Clothes** 

>>>>>
## Clothes

- As fakable as titles
- Con artists can adopt chameleon-style to lure their victims

Notes:
- Uniforms 
	- Police 
	- Security guard
	- etc
VVVVV
### Example - uniforms

- Requests from a young man, in  <span style="color:#3698e3">security guard uniform</span> or  <span style="color:#3698e3">normal clothes</span>
- Many people obey to the man  <span style="color:#3698e3">regardless of the type of request </span> when he was in <span style="color:#3698e3">uniform</span>

Notes: 
- Studies by social psychologist : Leonard Bickman

VVVVV
### Example - uniforms - variation

- The man stopped pedestrians (<span style="color:#3698e3">subjects</span>) and asked them to <span style="color:#3698e3">give a dime</span> to another person at the <span style="color:#3698e3">other side of a parking </span>
- In most cases, <span style="color:#3698e3">when uniform, the subjects gave the dime</span>, even if the man (with the uniform) was not able to see them
- When in <span style="color:#3698e3">normal clothes, only 50% gave a dime</span>

Notes: 
- The power of the uniform had still an effect on subjects


VVVVV
### Example - business suits

- Man in <span style="color:#3698e3">suit/normal</span> clothes crossing the street again traffic light
	- 3 ½ more people crossed when the man when in suit

>>>>>
## Trapping

![It's a trap](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/000/157/itsatrap.jpg)
from the movie "Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi" Copyright Disney/Lucas Art

VVVVV


Sign of wealth like expensive cars, jewelry can also be used to fool

Notes:    
- NDLR: "It's a trap!"  ?

VVVVV
### Car horn example 

- Study done in SF Bay Area,
- Do luxury cars get as much horn as economy cars?
	- Study finds that in most of the cases, economy cars have been horned at green traffic light
	- Only half of the luxury cars have been
	
Notes:
- Economy: 2 cars were even pushed by the car behind them 

>>>>>
## How to say no

- Increase awareness of authority power
	- Be able to know when authority must be followed or when it should be resisted 

2 questions to ask: 

- Is this authority truly an expert? 
- How truthful can we expect the expert to be here?
	
Notes: 
- 2 questions to help ourselves
- Can be used to find out if the authority is real 
- Q2: if expert, and if it is not in his interest to say explicitly the truth, maybe we should not trust him 
	- **Example Laywer : expert in his filed but if this lawyer is against us, maybe we should not trust him**
- NDLR: "how truthful" think back to McGarrity, the discussion about "ethos" in "introduction to public speaking". On the importance to show your goodwill.
