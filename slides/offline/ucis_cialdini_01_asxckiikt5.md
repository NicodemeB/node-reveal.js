# Influence - Chapter 1: Introduction

VVVVV
## Literature

"Cialdini, Robert Beno . Influence: The psychology of persuasion. 2007 Harper-Collins. ISBN 9780061241895"


VVVVV

## Structure

- Research question 
- How to find the factors
- Categories
- Transversal category

VVVVV
## What are the factors that cause one person to say yes to another ?

VVVVV
## How to find out ? 

- Experiment on students but not enough 
- Need professionals : Compliance practitioners 
	- People doing it all day long
	- i.e.: commercials, door-to-door people ...
- Took part of participant observation

VVVVV
## Six categories 

- Consistency 
- Reciprocation
- Social proof
- Authority
- Liking
- Scarcity


VVVVV
## Transversal category

- Self-interest 
	- People want to get the most and pay the least
	- Not treated separately 
		- Motivational given, as a goes-without-saying factor that deserves acknowledgment but not extensive description

# Weapons of influence:

VVVVV
## Structure 

- Fixed action pattern (FAP)
- Examples
- Automatic behavior patterns
- Summary 
- Contrast principle
- Reader report 
- Conclusion 

>>>>>
## Fixed action pattern (FAP)

- "Sequence of unlearned acts linked to a stimulus"
	- Color, shape, noise ...
- Always act in the same order

VVVVV
## Jewelry story

- Turquoise pieces were good quality for the price 
- Not buyer 
- The boss decides to do price x1/2
	- The employee understood x2
	- Sales increase drastically

Shortcut:

**good = expensive ↔ expensive = good**

Some fashion brands are selling shoes for $$$

## Palessi experiment cont'
- Payless social experiment
- Change name of the shop
- Make it look fancy 
- Sell 20 USD shoes 
	- For 250+ USD → 600 USD
![](https://framapic.org/3txczDes15jI/M7GzWnxJHPf6)

Notes:
- Payless is a shoes store in the US: bankruptcy in April 2017,
- Still alive on amazon apparently

## Palessi experiment - results

- Customers had been fooled,
- Customers had to “recognize” the (good?) “quality” of the $20 shoes 
	- If not, they would have publicly exposed their **non-consistency** and would have looked even more **stupid**
	- The shoes were “worth” their prize before they knew they were fooled

## Palessi experiment - conclusion 
Experiment clearly illustrated 

**good = expensive ↔ expensive = good** 

shortcut


VVVVV
## Turkey story

- Study made on a turkey and her children 
	- Remark that the turkey needs to ear cheep-cheep 
	- If the baby does not cheep, the mother kills him 

VVVVV
## Turkey experiment

- Material :
	- Stuffed model of polecat 
	- String to pull him up to the turkey
- Procedure        
	- Pull the fake polecat up to the mother
		- If cheep-cheep : accept and gather
		- If stop cheep-cheep : Attack
		- Otherwise : Attack
- Automation : Click and Whirr

VVVVV
## Limitation 

- Defending his territory 
	- FAP is activated when another male comes
	- BUT can be triggered by :
		- Same shape / color 
			- i.e. : Robin 
			- Attack clump of red breast
			- Ignore a replica of a male without red breast

VVVVV
## Conclusion

- "Pattern is recorded on a tape"
	- Based on an action, specific behaviour activated
		- i.e.: Cheep = mother 
- Works great for the animals
	- Only healthy baby cheep 
		- Nealy always correct behaviour
- Can dupe us if played at wrong time 
- Example video

VVVVV
## F.A.P.
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #c32c2c" -->

“*Fixed action patterns are said to be produced by the* ***innate*** *releasing mechanism, a * ***“hard-wired”*** * neural network, in response to a* ***sign stimulus*** *or* ***releaser***”

- Small fishes
- Males the males **guard the nest**
- Males during reproduction periods **→ red belly + aggressive** with other males
	- Because protecting the nest from other males

VVVVV
## F.A.P. - humans ?
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #c32c2c" -->

Notes:
- Not found but if you have an example 

VVVVV
## Human parallel

- When asking for something
	- i.e.: Xerox machine
		- With a real reason (94%)
			- "because I'm in rush"
		- Without a reason (60%)

VVVVV
## Human parallel 

- With a "fake" reason (93%)
	- "because I have to make copies"

VVVVV
## Human parallel con't

- "BECAUSE" trigger automatic compliance 

VVVVV
## Jewelry story explanation

- Based on previous example 
- Vacationers have little knowledge of turquoise
	- Used standard principle / stereotyped
		- "Expensive = good"
		- Was "cheap" : did not buy 
		- When became expensive : buy

VVVVV
## Jewelry story explanation

- People wanted good quality jewelries 
- Price reflects higher quality 
- Price is the trigger feature 
	- Linked price to quality 
	- Like turkey : do not cross evidences
		- Only shortcut 

VVVVV
## Positive reinforcement
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #c32c2c" -->
- *Encouraging a certain* ***behavior*** *through a system of praise and* ***rewards***
- Rewards are a **reinforcing stimulus**.
- Adding a **desirable stimulus** to increase a **behavior**
Notes:
- source : https://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-positive-reinforcement.html

VVVVV
## Negative reinforcement
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #c32c2c" -->
- Taking away an **undesirable stimulus** to increase a **behavior**

VVVVV

## Big bang theory summary

### Positive reinforcement 

Chocolate 

### Negative reinforcement

>>>>>
## Automatic behavior patterns

- Environment full of stimulus 
- Impossible to analyse everything        
	- Aspects of each situation / person / event
	- Need shortcut
	- Otherwise : we would freeze to calculate each component 

VVVVV
## Insect case 

- Insects are severe exploiters
- Photuris Female cracked the courtship code 
- Send flash signals to the prey 
	- Goes there and die instead of finding love

VVVVV
## Saber-toothed blenny

- Small fish cleaning teeth of a big fish 
	- When he comes, the big one freeze 
	- To be cleaned
- Could be tricked and attacked thinking it was the saber-toothed

VVVVV
## Saber-toothed blenny

- We can fix a parallel with humans 
	- We choose the right words : "enemy" trigger
		- But he is manipulated (i.e.: "because")
	- Need to :
		- Structure the request
		- Chose well words 

VVVVV
## Summary

- Two mechanisms
	- Nearly menachanism process 
		- To trigger (i.e.: price, cheep-cheep ...) 
	- Consequent exploitability
		- From people who know how to activate

VVVVV
## Jujitsu

- Use minimal strength against the opponent 
- Trigger existing stores of influence
	- Redirect it toward the target
- Manipulation without being detected

>>>>>
## Contrast principle 

- Date a beautiful woman 
- Date another one less attractive 
- The second one will strike us as less attractive than she really is

VVVVV
## Contrast principle

- Putting a hand in : 
	- Hot water
	- Cold water 
- Then putting both hands in temperate water 
	- Hot hand seems to have cold 
	- Cold hand seems to be hot

VVVVV
## Contrast principle

- Lift two objects 
	- Heavy one 
	- Light one
- First lift heavy one, the second seems lighter
- First lift light one, the second seems heavier

VVVVV
## Retail clothiers

- Sale person present firstly expensive item 
- Then a cheaper one 
	- Then the second looks a better deal  
- Otherwise : 
	- If we revert  
	- The second would seem "too expensive"

VVVVV
## Real estate

- Start with undesirable houses 
	- Setup properties 
	- Houses very expensive and not great 
- Then show the good houses 
	- Clients love them
	- They buy easier

## Contrast - Same or different ?

<a href="http://samesameordifferent.com" target="_blank">Same or different ?</a>

Notes:
- visual example of the contrast principle, because of the color we cannot correctly estimate both rectangles are the same 
- optical illusion; some other examples

Notes:
- Contrast bias, other types of bias at work, 



VVVVV
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #c32c2c" -->
## Other forms of bias

- Similarity bias
- Conformity bias
- The recency bias
- etc

Notes:
- Similarity bias; same as others advantage
- Conformity bias; not the same as other, disadvantage 
- The recency bias; someone doing something for you: first favor, etc 
>>>>>
## Reader report

- Invent a life 
	- Fracture and hospital
	- Get married
	- Pregnant 
- Then explain it is fake 
	- Explain about the D and F 
- Contrast principle
	- de-dramatise the notes in history and chemistry

VVVVV
## Conclusion 

- Too many stimuli
- Education creates 
	- stereotypes 
	- shortcuts
		- Can be great in certain cases
		- But sometimes could be wrong
- Take care with shortcut used against us 
- We are manipulated without knowing
