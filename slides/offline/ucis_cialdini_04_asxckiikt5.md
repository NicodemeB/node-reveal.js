# Introduction

VVVVV
## The tendency to believe that a behaviour is appropriate from the moment others adopt it.

- Pre-recorded laugh
- Remember "tchip tchip"?

Notes:

1. nobody likes pre-recorded laugh yet it is still around
- It tricks our brain into believing it is funny because others find it funny 
- This shorcut is so often used that the reaction is automatic 

2. The second example was used in the introduction chapter. The turkey thinks the thing doing  "tchip tchip" is her healthy sparrow even when said "tchip tchip" is coming from a recorder in a polecat doll. The same principle is at work when a laugh pre-recorded and used without context still make us laugh.

As we saw in the introduction, humans have a need for shorcuts and looking at others people action is one of them. It too can be exploited.

This doesn't only apply to the tv, in the next slide we will see some other examples.


VVVVV
## A few more examples

- Money on the bartender's counter
- Money already in the basket at church
- Billy Graham visiting a town
- Advertisement

Notes:
Graham is an american evangelist preacher 
- 6000 people go to the town to move forward at different good moments to create the effect of a population walking froward spontaneously.

Money is already put in the church basket to make people believe that everyone is giving.

- Advertisement: 
 - "the favorite cheese of the belgians"
 - "interview in the street, actors presenting themselves as regular people"
        
In the next slides we will see that the effect can also be used in positive ways



VVVVV
## Fixing pathological behaviour

- Psychologist Albert Bandura 
- Children from three to five years scared of dogs
- Psychologist Robert O'Connor
- Integration to a group

Notes:
Showing a real child playing with real dog to children afraid of dogs will help them get rid of their fear of dogs.
This can be done by showing them a movie.
The effect is more efficient if a lot of kids are shown doing it instead of only 1 (This example is explained in p. 172 of the book)

Now we are going to look for the causes with an other exemple (in the next slide)


>>>>>
# Uncertainty: The case of the Chicago Sect

VVVVV
## The Chicago Sect
- Three researchers from the university of Minnesota infiltrate 
- Never more than 30 members
- Automatic writting 
- End of the world 

Notes:
Small sect, only accepted those who came to them but not looking for recruits
lot of secrecy, no comments to journalists

The idea is that a women get messages from extraterrestrial beings called "the guardians" and write their messages through Automatic writting

Before the end of world, at the date given  the guardians will take the believer away in spaceships

The night of end of world nothing happened
all of them are under shock, very slowly their conviction start to shatter

new message from aliens they have decided to let everyone survive because the little group had so much devotion - paraphrasing

a few minutes later women call a journal and saying that it's the first time she is calling them as she never had anything to tell them before but now she feels the urge to do so
and all the members of the group started as well, feeling the same urge

They all have lost too much to stop believing
A new type of proof is needed: namely the **social proof**

# Cause of death: uncertainty

VVVVV
## The case of Catherine Genoverse
- New York 1964
- Over 35 witness
- Attacker followed and attacked the victim three times (an fled twice)
- Consensus: "the apathy of big cities"

Notes:
The killer fled because of lights turning on in homes but eventually always came back

Witnesses couldn't say why they did nothing

The consensus at the time was "the apathy of big cities" - that people lacked of empathy



VVVVV
## Latané & Darley
- Shared/diluated responsability
- It is not obvious that there is an emergency

Notes:
not nobody did anything despite 35 witness but nobody did anything because of 35 witness

eg. guy lying down in the street: dead or drunk
    are there shots in the street or is it the noise of a motor
        
in times of uncertainty we look around us to see others reaction
but others might be also looking around, generally while keeping their compusure, looking just discreetly 
and thus nobody takes action because since everyone seems calm, everything must be alright


VVVVV
## experiments and quantification
- Epileptic seizure in New York: 
  - alone: 85%
  - 5 people: 31%
- Smoke from behind a door in New York: 
  - alone: 75%
  - 3 people: 38%
  - 2 actors and an individual: 10%
  
Notes:
  
florida 2 experiement - 2 for the other | both alone and in group
        
more chance to be saved alone than by a group, especially a group of strangers since they might not interpret the uncertainty of the others properly 

  
VVVVV
## Experiments and quantification
- Toronto: 
  - alone: 90%
  - with two actors: 16%
- Four distinct experiments in Florida:
  - Clearly looking wounded : 100% 
  - Clearly looking wounded 
  + risk of touching an electrical wire : 90% 
  

Notes:
florida 2 experiement - 2 for the other | both alone and in group
        
more chance to be saved alone than by a group, especially a group of strangers since they might not interpret the uncertainty of the others properly 

big towns: strangers, more people so probably in a group, more noise harder to be sure of what's going on

# How to avoid becoming a victim of uncertainty

VVVVV
## How to avoid becoming a victim of uncertainty

- uncertainty is not apathy
- make the situation clear
- choose someone and give him the responsability

Notes:
screaming is not enough

more people will stop and help once they see some people help you because of the social proof


>>>>>
# The similarity factor

Notes:
        We are more willing to follow the exemple of someone similar
        Think about advertisement i talked about before


VVVVV
## Experiment of the univerity of Columbia (New York)

- envelope containing a wallet adressed to the owner
  - contact information
  - small bills (2 dollars) and some checks (26 & 30 dollars)
  - a note 
- similar: 70%
- different: 33%


Notes:
        the note says how happy the person is to help by sending back that wallet that he/she find
        making people think that the wallet was lost twice
        written in good or poor english (foreigner that arrived recently)
        good english being similar to the majority of americans
        sent back
        /!\ this plays in the previous exemple about fixing pathological behaviors
    more p 204
        


VVVVV
## Werther effect

- a highly publicized suicide increases the number of car and plane accidents
- "The Sorrows of Young Werther", Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, 1774 
- David Philips from the University of California-San Diego
- Heavyweight  boxing match between 1973 & 1978

Notes:
        the more it was publicized in an area, the more accidents & suicide there is - so it's proportional 
        thus not linked to social conditon like we might think (same social condistions making one guy suicide are making other nervous too)
        also when it is a suicide commited by a group of people or a suicide with murder then accidents with more than one casualities rise too
        book where the charachter kills himself
        lauch a suicide wave accross europe
        was forbidden in some counries
        according to him individuals having difficulties will determine their behaviors based on other people with difficulties 
        and thus the accident would actually be hidden suicide 
        people who want to hide the suicide to their family 
        in more analysis of statistics 
        Philips realized that when it was a young that commited suicide, it was the suicide/accident of young people that rised
        If the looser was black, the number of young black people murdered rised 
        If the looser was white, the number of white people murdered rised 
        imitative agression/murder


VVVVV
## Collective suicide of Jonestown 18 november 1978

- Jim Jones
- Guyana

Notes:
One last example


>>>>>
# How to say no

VVVVV
## Two types of situations

- falsified clues
- natural/innocent mistake


Notes:
Pay attention for obvious falsified clues  
Need to "disconnect" from automatic mode

Take the time to check if that information is not opposite to other sources of information
        


>>>>>
# Conclusion

Notes:
the social proof is a 
useful shortcut that allow us to take decisions without having to measure the advantages and drawbacks
but it can received wrong information and be fooled
        


VVVVV
## Conclusion

- 13 reasons why
  - "the overall suicide rate among 10- to 17-year-olds increased significantly in the month immediately following the release of 13 Reasons Why" 
_Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry_

Notes: 
    - One characteristic that these diverse contexts share is that there are frequently large differences between researchers and their participants, such as differences in background, social status     culture, language, education, and technical expertise. 
    
    - Unfortunately, these differences have been shown to substantially impact researchers’ efforts to evaluate their new designs or interventions.
    
-  In particular, usability studies and field evaluations frequently suffer from high levels of participant response bias , defined as the extent to which participants provide researchers with feedback or results  that will please the researchers or help to achieve the research goals 

- As a result, many researchers have found it challenging to obtain critical or negative feedback from participants that could help them to improve their designs or interventions

Notes: 
- Conducted a series of controlled experiments that systematically influence participant response bias using the concept of social proof (or informational social influence) from the field of social psychology

- Prior to watching the video, participants in the positive and negative conditions received social proof through
subtle exposure to three positive and negative ‘video reviews’, respectively, that they perceived to have been provided byother participants ‘like them
