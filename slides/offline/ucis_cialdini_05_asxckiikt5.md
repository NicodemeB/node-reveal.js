VVVVV

## Tupperware 

![Social Proof](https://webcdn-adespressoinc.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/social-proof3-1024x535.jpg)

Notes:
- Social proof 
	- once the buying begins, each purchase builds the idea that other, similar people want the product; therefore, it must be good

## Tupperware 

![Liking rule](https://d1avok0lzls2w.cloudfront.net/img_uploads/persuasion-liking.gif)

Notes:
- Liking rule 
	- It comes from a friens to every woman in the room
- Src : https://d1avok0lzls2w.cloudfront.net/img_uploads/persuasion-liking.gif
VVVVV

## Tupperware party 

- Hostest 
	- Call friends 
	- Take tea, refreshments 
- Tupperware provide a percentage of the take 
	- People than buy *from* and *for* a friend 

Notes:
- The strengh of that social bond is twice as likely to determine product purchage as is preference for the product

VVVVV

## Tupperware 

- " I fell like I have to go"
- "When I get there, I feel like I have to buy something"

VVVVV

## Charity organisation 

Notes: 
-Recruting volonteers close to their own home 
	- Same  principle as Tupperware when you know the seller

VVVVV

## Endless chain

![Endless chain](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e1/f5/13/e1f513238e3a5f4dd50dc312bc9e3ffc.jpg)

Notes:
- Src : https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e1/f5/13/e1f513238e3a5f4dd50dc312bc9e3ffc.jpg

VVVVV

## Endless chain

- Method to find new customers 
- If he likes 
	- Ask for friends who would like too 

Notes:
- He likes
	- We use him to introduce the product to his friend 
	- We tell them that he likes and he recommends it to them
- Same effect as Tupperware selling method

VVVVV

## Conclusion 
- Sellers are "armed" with the name of this friend 
	- Refuse the offer would almost be like rejecting the friend

VVVVV
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #c32c2c" -->
### Halo effect - women experiment

- Response time 
	- avg attractive person **<** avg normal person
- When attractive, men do whatever the attractive woman ask 
	- Sex related ?
		- If so, **really interesting for social engineering**
		
VVVVV
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #c32c2c" -->
### Halo effect - men experiment

- Does the size really matter ?

VVVVV
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #c32c2c" -->
### Halo effect - men experiment

# Similarity

VVVVV
![](https://outsideperception.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/unique-you-are-unique-just-like-everybody-else.jpg)

VVVVV

## Facts 

- We "like" people who are "similar" to us

Notes:

    
* NDLR: such a slide cannot be left like this. It should always be accompanied by the ref. And probably, "like" should be written with quotes, idem for similar. To put an emphasis on the fact that it depends on the definition of such terms. Otherwise it's fine. I would have written "Title: Similar -> Like. Content: "It was demonstrated that there is a correlation (and causation) from similarity to liking"

VVVVV

## Example - Dress style

![](https://medias.liberation.fr/photo/1231738-checknews.jpg?modified_at=1561735708&width=960https://medias.liberation.fr/photo/1231738-checknews.jpg?modified_at=1561735708&width=960)

Notes:
- Dress
	- We are more likely to help people dress like us
- Experiment 
	- **Hippie and straight fashion**
		- Ask for 10 cent to call 
		- When dress in the same way get more often 10 cent
	- **Petitions**
		- If dress in the same way, they sign without reading

- NDLR: each element here should have it's ref.
- NDLR: personally ... I would not use picture of minors in a presentation

Notes:
    This slide is intended as a joke

VVVVV

## Goal 

- Claim they have background and interest same to ours 
- Increase sells 
	- I.E.: Car seller 

Notes: 
- Car seller
	- Trained to look for evidences 
		- golf balls on the back : "I hope the weather will be great to play the eighteen holes later in the day"
		- Camping gear in the trunk : "I love to get away from the with when I can"
		- If not in the same state : "Oh, my wife / me come from this state too" 

VVVVV

## Conclusion 

- Put people in a way that they fell good 
- More likely to buy something from people with 
	- Same age
	- religion
	- Politics 
	- ... 
- Create a positive response 


VVVVV
### Similarity bias
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #c32c2c" -->

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lcgOvA9yUw0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<small> https://resources.insideoutdev.com/videos, (last visited Nov. 27, 2019). </small>

VVVVV
### Similarity bias
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #c32c2c" -->

- Same haircutter → derivate from the performance evaluation 
- → We “**like**” people who are “**similar**” to us 
	- Get maximum score

Notes:
- As written higher in the slides, we like ...

Next: "example" of how it could be "easy" to find similarities
TV2 Denmark

VVVVV
### Similarity bias
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #c32c2c" -->
“““““Always possible to find somme similarities””””””

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jD8tjhVO1Tc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

VVVVV
### Similarity bias
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #c32c2c" -->

- Event if we may not have the same look, in most of the case, this is possible to have similarities with someone, 
- Could be used against us

>>>>>
# Compliments

VVVVV

## Example car seller

- Send one card per month to customer 
	- Holiday greeting change 
	- Back of the card remains the same 

VVVVV

## Impression

- Could be interpreted very impersonal 

Notes: 

- Same card and message for every one 

VVVVV

## Experiment

- Received comments from someone who needs a favor

Notes:
- Comments 
	- Positive comments 
	- Negative comments 
	- Mixed comment  

VVVVV

## Findings 

- Positive comments 
	- Liked best 
	- Comments produce as much liking when they are true or not

Notes:
- Even if people feel they are manipulated, they have an automatic positive reaction to compliments


VVVVV
### Compliment bias
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #c32c2c" -->


- Experiment about complimenting students 
- When triggered, can be exploited ? 


VVVVV
### Compliment bias
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #c32c2c" -->
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aW8BDgLpZkI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

VVVVV
### Similarity bias
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #c32c2c" -->

- In most of the case, **people reacted**
	- Some did not 
- Could be used to **trigger reciprocity**
- Biased? 
	- **Young people** in the video, maybe be overreaction for some ?

Notes:
- R''"é@eciprocity : maybe asking a favor

# Contact and cooperation

VVVVV

We like things that are familiar to us 

VVVVV

## Mirror experiment

![](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e4/f5/45/e4f5451a6e8ead10324ccaa4c189e786.jpg)

Notes:
- Dev a pair of picture 
	- One as people see us 
	- One as we see us in the mirror (our reflect) 
- Other people prefer the one like they see us 
- We prefer the one we see in the mirror (transposed one)

VVVVV

## Politician example 

![](https://www.voicesofyouth.org/sites/default/files/images/2019-01/politics3.jpg)

Notes:
- Ohio election 
	- Change his name before the election 
	- Had not a lot of chance to win the election but thanks to the change 
	- Took a name familiar for people in Ohio "Brown"
- src: (https://www.voicesofyouth.org/sites/default/files/images/2019-01/politics3.jpg

VVVVV

## Example - Conclusion 

- We do not realise that we have been influenced 
- It depends on the number of time we have been exposed before

VVVVV

## Facts 

- We are more favorable toward the things we have had contact with


VVVVV

Notes: 
- Faces of several individuals were flashed on a screen so quickly that later on, the subject who were exposed to the faces in this manner couldn't recall having seen any of them before
- The most the face were flashed, the most the person was liked

	- School disintegration 
	- Unpleasant situation 

VVVVV

## Causes 

- Ethnical difference 
- Competitive process 
	- Do not encourage anyone to look benevolently 
	- More personal, self centred
	
VVVVV
	
## Solutions 

- Cooperative approach
	- Jigsaw


Notes: 

- Jigsaw 
	- Student cooperates 
	- Became allies instead of ennemies
- Consequences : 
	- Conjoint effort toward common goal lead to 
		- Begun to intermix at the meal table 
		- On listing their friend : significant higher number

# Condition and association 

"Don't kill the messenger!"

Notes:
    "Don't kill the messenger" is not just an expression. It's required to say it over and over again because messengers are usually associated to the message

VVVVV

## Weather man 

- "Why do they  blame me, Doc ?"

![](https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/590x/secondary/Tomasz-Schafernaker-best-weather-presenter-951922.jpg)

Notes:
- Role : charged to annonce the result of the battle
	- If victory : treated like a hero, food, drink, women, ... 
	- If disaster : would be slain (killed)
- Src : (https://media.gadventures.com/media-server/cache/ba/4d/ba4d15b3f25b52cffd145b96643b25fa.jpg

VVVVV

## Conclusion 

- The nature of the information infects the teller
- Natural human tendency to dislike people bringing bad news

Notes:
- If the weatherman goes in a state with a lot of sun, cool for him 
- But if this state is full of farmer, they need water, there is always a "bad" side
- But most of people will associate him to good weather and like him

VVVVV

## Advertisement

- If the advertisement has an attractive woman 
	- The car is rated as faster 
- Athlete are used to promote 
	- Relevant to their role
		- Sport shoes, tennis racket, golf ball 
	- Irrelevant 
		- soft, popcorn, 

VVVVV

## Pavlov 
 
- Important vote are made during the diner 
	- #Reciprocation 
	- Associate good food so they vote easier for the law 

VVVVV

## Sport case

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Titans_Texans.jpg)

Notes:
- When the team of the supporter wins
	- "WE WIN"
- When they loose 
	- "They loose"
- We detach ourself from the bad event at anchor the good one

# How to say no

VVVVV

## Techniques 

- Need a general approach to neutralise the influence 
	- I.E.: He brings us some coffee ? #reciprocity
- Mentally detach the seller from the sell 
	- Still a good deal ?
	- Distance yourself. Notice if you like someone and in such case, double check your decision

Notes:
- Approach 
	- Timing approach:
		- Not trying to prevent it on  you
		- If we fell that an influence has been proceed, let them know that you are aware 
		- Focus on the effect and not on the cause !
		- IE: if we elle we like the practitioner without any reason, it smells fishy
