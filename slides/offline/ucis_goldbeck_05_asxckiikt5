# Usability - Chapter 5 
### Usable Authentication: authentication mechanisms, biometrics, two-factor authentication

VVVVV
## Structure 

- Usable Authentication and how to make passwords more usable 
- Biometric authentification
- Gesture based authentification
- Attacks of those alternative authentification systems

Notes:
- First password: usability & security issues + modern solutions to help usability and/or security including 2FA 
- Then we are going to look at some other alternatives

## Role B structure

- Biometric authentication vs. usability → (2019) Security ?
	- <a href="#/34/7"> Face recognition </a>
	- Fingerprint 
	- Voice authentication 
	
Notes:
- (2019) → Somme videos (i.e. MythBusters one) are not from the last 2 years 
- Could be interesting to see how these biometric system are "safe"→ and its scary how they are not/will not be for long

VVVVV
## Issue: learnability and memorability of the password

- Change frequently
- Different password for every websites

<aside class="notes">
  - Every 6 months </br>
  - hundreds</br> </br>
  We need to find a usable yet secure way to create password </br>
  So let's start by looking at attacks
</aside>

VVVVV
## Passwords Attacks

- Human attack
- Brute Force
- Common word

<aside class="notes">
  - ask </br>
  - guess</br>
  - post-it </br></br>
  - such as common password </br>
  - normal dictionnary
</aside>

<aside class="notes">
 100 password request per second.</br></br> The result is the approach that is the most effective way to hack that specific password </br></br>
 - either being by the use of brute-force, common words or dictionary attacks.

## ICloud attack: iDict

Account Lockout restrictions and Secondary Authentication on any account."_

<aside class="notes">
Just bypass limitation
</aside>

VVVVV
## Conclusion on password
- Password systems would be more secure if passwords were more usable
 - human reasons 
 - computational reasons

<aside class="notes">
        human write it down post-it or forget it </br>
        common and not real word</br>
        because the security people probably are afraid of going that route, even though there's the math to prove that it's good, and its difficult to change the status quo.

</aside>

VVVVV
## Two Factor Authentication
- Password + one time unique code
- Given by: 
 - Device (eg. Rsa secure ID key)
 - Email
 - Text
 - App

<aside class="notes">


rsa key: unique id key linked to account + token change over time

skip(something you have - something you are - something you know)
</aside>

VVVVV

## Security & Usability of Two Factor Authentication

- More secure
- Slower
- user preference:
 - less usable
 - less convenient
 - harder to use

<aside class="notes">
2 infos 
need to get a device, limited over time 
extra steps, user understand it's more secure

good 2fa? detecting when connecting from a new device ( my point)

conclusion more secure 
less usable
we should rely on something else

# Biometric authentification

VVVVV
## Introduction

- using a person biology to identify them 
- look for something unique
 - fingerprints
 - eye scan
 - facial recognition (distances and proportions)
 - voice prints (tone, pitch, timbre,...)

<aside class="notes">
pin or password are frustrating </br> biometrics can make it easier </br></br>

-facial: select important points on the face </br>
distances & porportions
</aside>

VVVVV
## Usability

- Voice recognition
 - Speed: medium
 - Efficienty: medium 
 - Learnability: easy 
 - Memorability: easy
 
<aside class="notes">
Efficienty: rate of errors</br>
eg. noisy room: vacuum

</aside>

VVVVV
## Usability

- Facial recognition
 - Speed: medium
 - Efficienty: medium 
 - Learnability: easy 
 - Memorability: easy
 
<aside class="notes">
Efficienty: rate of errors </br>
eg. lighting situation

</aside>

VVVVV
## Usability

- Fingerprint recognition
 - Speed: fast
 - Efficienty: good 
 - Learnability: easy 
 - Memorability: easy
 
<aside class="notes">
efficiency: wrong position or dirty
</aside>

VVVVV
## Security

- Remote or not?
- How easily can we replicate it?
 - Jan Krissler used high resolution photos to recreate the fingerprints of Germany’s defence minister (VeriFinger)</br> https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/30/hacker-fakes-german-ministers-fingerprints-using-photos-of-her-hands
- You can’t replace physical identifiers
 
<aside class="notes">
depends if remote access or not </br>
eg. pin 4 bank but card so physical access </br></br>
recording voice - saying right thing </br>
photo right light </br>
good fingerprint</br></br>

so security low but hard to duplicate</br></br>

The Office of Personnel Management breach in 2015 compromised 5.6 million people’s fingerprints. And unlike passwords, credit cards, or other records, you can’t replace physical identifiers. If someone has photos of your iris, you can’t get another eye.

databases of fingerprints

</aside>

VVVVV
## Conclusion

- easy to use
- relatively secure if physical access 
- compare usability

<aside class="notes">
if paswword too hard to use </br>
they will turn it off or find a way to avoid it </br></br>

## Face recognition - 2D vs. 3D
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #c32c2c" -->

→ 2D: "A facial recognition system is a technology capable of identifying or verifying a person **from a digital image** or a video frame **from a video** source"

→ 3D FR can also be bypassed

→ More **famous/social** → **less secure** ? 

Notes:

My point of view : the more photography/videos certainly impact the security of the system

# Gesture based authentification

VVVVV
## Introduction

- keypad gesture
- free gesture

<aside class="notes">
are given 9 points, usually laid out in the form of a keyboard. And they're asked to pick a gesture that connects those points together </br></br>

whatever kind of gesture they want </br>
These are biometrically based because even if someone else comes in, and tries to do the same gesture there will be subtle differences in the way two people enter it.</br>
multi touch</br>
signature
</aside>

VVVVV
## Benefits

- Gestures user enjoy are more secure </br>
- user prefer gesture to password </br>
- faster and less error prone

<aside class="notes">
- makes parallel between user preference and usability</br></br>
- easier to remember </br></br>
- speed and efficiency</br>

## Case study: Smudge Attacks on Smartphone Touch Screens

- Android password pattern
- camera angles and lighting conditions
- clean <> dirty 
- normal touch <> light touch
- contrast



<aside class="notes">
Due to the intermediate contact point restriction, the </br>
password space of the Android password pattern contains</br>
389,112 possible patterns </br></br>
camera angles and lighting conditions under which latent “smudge patterns” can be recovered from touchscreen devices</br></br>
a lot of information if dirty

VVVVV
## Conclusion

- New types of attack
- Human-based with a twist

<aside class="notes">

It's not human's social engineering </br>
a little bit more sneakiness than we normally think of with human attacks </br>
 and a little bit of analysis in order to recover password information. </br>
still needs to gain access to your device + figure out what your password is </br>

## B Role observations 

- What about revocation when compromised ?
	- → I have only **1 face, 10 fingers, 1 voice**
- What about using different "password" on different systems to avoid all systems to be compromised at once ? 
	- → Still only **1 face, 10 fingers, 1 voice**
- What about publicity of our biometrics ? 
	- → Social media ? Impossible for** VIPs**

Not based on scientific paper, just a bit of self observation + web research
