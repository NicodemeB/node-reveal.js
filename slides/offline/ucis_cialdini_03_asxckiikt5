## Consistency: The principle of consistency

VVVVV
### Consistency: What is it?
- Conformity in the application of something, typically that which is necessary for the sake of logic, accuracy, or fairness (Oxford dictionary)
- Our nearly obsessive desire to be **consistent with what we have done**;
- The willingness to believe in correctness even if difficult choice has been made
- Like other weapons of influence
	- Consistency lies **deep within us**
	- Consistency directing our actions with quiet power

Notes:        
- Consistency is the kind of** trait that we desire** for personal requirements
or through system that we do build
- Indeed, we all **fool ourselves** from time to time in order to **keep thoughts
and beliefs consistent** with what we have already done or decided
- Prominent theorists such as Leon Festinger, Fritz Hieder, and Theodore Newcomb have viewed the desire for consistency as a central motivator of our behavior

VVVVV
### Consistency: Illustration
- The **horse race betting** consistency's illustration        
- New York city **beach thefts** staging illustration
	- When subjects are a not addressed, they are reluctant, **4/20** take action to stop the theft
	- When subjects are addressed, propelled by the rule for consistency **19/20** take actions

Notes:
- The horse race betting illustration:
    - A study done by a pair of canadian psychologists uncovered something fascinating about people at the racetrack: Just after placing a bet, they are much more confident of their horse’s chances of winning than they are immediately before laying down that bet.1 Of course, nothing about the horse’s chances actually shifts; it’s the same horse, on the same track, in the same field; but in the minds of those bettors, its prospects improve significantly once that ticket is purchased.
- New York City beach thefts staging:
	- 2 cases : 
		- Do not ask subjects on the beach to have a look to our stuff, have a accomplice stealing our the stuff, 
		- Ask subjects to have a look to the stuff,
	→ More subjetc chased the thief when they were asked to have a look at the stuff

VVVVV
### Automatic consistency: The art of our comfort zone

- Automatic consistency can supply a safe hiding place
- Sealed within the fortress walls of rigid consistency, we can be impervious to the sieges of reason.
- The Transcendental mediation's illustration

Notes:
- Sometimes it is not the effort of hard, cognitive work that makes us shirk thoughtful activity, but the harsh consequences of that activity. Sometimes it is the cursedly clear and unwelcome set of answers provided by straight thinking that makes us mental slackers. There are certain disturbing things we simply would rather not realize. Because it is a preprogrammed and mindless method of responding, automatic consistency can supply a safe hiding place from those troubling realizations. Sealed within the fortress walls of rigid consistency, we can be impervious to the sieges of reason.

Benjamin:

- Automatic: **automatic reaction** triggered by the consistency: **reply to someone claiming you're saying something wrong**

VVVVV
### Consistency: Importance

![](https://framapic.org/hi4T2ksUffyO/9MR5W93cEzN7)

VVVVV
### Consistency: Importance

- Why does consistency is so important?
	- In most circumstances consistency is valued and adaptive
	- Its opposite, inconsistency, is commonly thought to be and **undesirable personal trait**
	- Good Personal consistency is highly valued in our culture

Notes:
Benjamin:
Inconsistency is not desirable → induce multiple unwanted traits : 

- Do not know what you want, what you think 
- "Retourner sa veste"
- ...

VVVVV
### Our vulnerability to consistency

- Often causing us to act in ways that are clearly contrary to our **own best interest**
- When it occurs unthinkingly, in an **automatic** way, consistency can be disastrous
- Like other forms of automatic responding, it offers shortcut through the density of modern life
- Automatic consistency functions as a shield against thought and thus being exploitable.
- The drive to be consistent constitutes a highly potent weapon of social influence
- The seasonal sale issues illustration

Notes:
Benjamin:
- We can adopt some **behavior** because of consistency: **not** all the time in **our best interest**
- Automatic: **without** any **thoughts** → could induce us to think/say something wrong 
- ...

## Social Experiment: Will they stop the thief

<iframe width="560" height="250" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JquoUE2a9EA?start=50" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Notes: 
was an example in the book for a __strong consistency__
give __intuition commitement__ is how to obtain it

it was also a __solution__  to the __social proof principle__ 
so i guess we will see more example of that in the next presentation

## Commitment

- Context: Consistency is formidable in directing human action;

![](https://framapic.org/MRk6kWBAg8Lq/0fUHQe65GfWF)

But, how can we get  this powerful consistency tapes activated?

VVVVV
### Commitment: What is it?

- An engagement or obligation that restricts freedom of action, the state or quality of being dedicated to a cause, activity;
	- Responsibility, **obligation**, **duty**, burden
	- liability, pressure, dedication, loyalty
- There is a connection between commitment and consistency
- Commitment strategies are aimed at us by compliance professionals

Notes: 
Each of these strategies is intended to get us to take some action or make some statement that will trap us later into compliance through consistency pressures.

Benjamin:
To my view: simply make someone stand for something, make this someone have an opinion on a subject 

VVVVV
### Procedures to create commitment

- They may take various form
- Some are straightforward; others are among the most subtle compliance tactics
- The door-to-door donations collections illustration

Notes:
Benjamin:
- Ask someone how is he doing before asking the real question : 

VVVVV
### Procedures to create commitment: illustration
- The telephone solicitors for charity crafty technic illustration
	- The he psychologist Steven J. Sherman called sample of Bloogmington, Indiana, residents
	- Asked  for reaction IF asked to spend 3 hours collecting money for America Cancer Society (looking for small commitment)
		- Getting representative from ACS to call few days later looking for  volunteers

Notes:
For instance you want to increase the number of people
in your area who would agree to go door-to-door
collecting donations for your favorite charity.

- Use the approach used by the psychologist Steven J. Sherman
	- Calling sample of Bloomington, Indiana, residents as part of a survey he was taking and asked them to predict they WOULD say if asked to spend three hours collecting money for America Cancer Society (looking for small commitment)
	- At the same fashion the solicitors could have asked during the process about health and well being. The fact is not because they are polite or are looking for your well being, but they are looking for you to say you are fine. Once you state this publicly, it becomes much easier for them to ask you to contribute with donation to help out unfortunate victim

VVVVV
### Effectiveness of  commitment

- What makes a commitment effective?
	- The **Chinese POW**  illustration
		- leniency policy
		- Concerted and sophisticated psychological assault on captive
		- **Start small and build**
	- The** foot-in-door technique**
		- Start with little request in order to gain eventual compliance with larger request
- Not all commitment affect self-image. There are certain required conditions for commitment to be effective

- Tips:  Use small commitments to manipulate a person's self-image

Notes:
- During the Korean war many American soldier found themselves as POC camps run by Chinese
- Chinese in the opposite of their counterpart North Koreans, used the lenient policy
- The Chinese heavily relied on commitment and consistency pressure to gain the desired compliance from
prisoners
- Problem faced by Chinese: how to get any collaboration at from men who where trained to provide nothing byt name name, rank and serial number?
Answer was sample: start small  and build (foot in the door principle)

Tactic used:
- Prisoners were frequently asked to make so mildly (without anger) to anti American or pro-Communist such
   - US is not perfect. In communist country unemployment is not a problem (small request)
- Push for bigger request
   - A man who stated that the US is not perfect might then be asked to describe in which way.
   - Once the man explained himself, he then asked for to make a list of " problems with American and sigh his name on it
   - Later he might then be asked to read them in discussion group with other prisoners
   - The Chinese then might use his name  and his essay in anti American radio broadcast
   - Aware that he had written the essay the essay without any strong thread or coercion, many times a man
would change his image of himself to be consistent with the deed and with the new collaborator.

- /!\ read after
- One stayed forever
- One refused more rations etc desiring to be treated equal - ended up leaving though
- In the us some were sent to asylum

My point => 
- Consistency define who we are in your own eyes
- What actions we will take in the future
- Effect are permanant

## Useful tactics to get commitment

- The Magic Act
- The Public Eye
- The Effort Extra
- The Inner Choice

VVVVV
### The magic act

- People's true feeling & belief come less from their words than from their deed
	- The principle of self perception
	- The principle of **written statement**:
		- Providing physical **evidence** that the **act occurred**;
		- Given a mechanism to influence other's thinking with one's idea;
	- The influence of active commitment on consistency
		- 1: From the **inside**: there is pressure to bring self image into line  with action
		- 2: From the **outside**: sneakier pressure → a tendency to adjust this image according to they way others perceive us.

Notes:
- The influence's of active commitment on consistency: Once active commitment is made, self-image is squeezed from two sides by consistency pressure

VVVVV
#### The principle of written statement in business world

- Compliance professionals also know about the committing power of written statement
- The door-to-door sales companies illustrations
	- Context: The cooling-off laws
	- Getting customers themselves to write to fill out sales agreement
	- Resulting in reducing the number of sales cancellation

Notes:
- The principle of written statement
	- Once a man wrote what the Chinese wanted, it was very difficult for him to believe he had not done so.
	- The opportunities to forget or to deny to himself what he had done where not available as they are for purely verbal statements

VVVVV
### The public eye
- The public commitment principle
	- Public commitment tend to be lasting commitments
	- Whenever ones takes stand  that is visible to others, there arises a drive:
		- To maintain that stand in order  look like a consistent person
		- For appearance's sake, the more public a stand, the more reluctant we will be to change it.
			- Illustration

Notes:
- Public commitment principle
	- To continue with example of the Chinese POW: the Chinese constantly arranged to have pro-communist statement of their captives seen by others
- Illustration:
	- According to Deutsch and Gerard findings  that we are truest to our decisions if we have bound ourselves to them publicly can be put to good use.
- The weight-loss:  
	- Weight-reduction clinics will require  down an immediate weigh loss goal and show that goal to as many friends, relatives and neighbors possible
- Woman stop smoking:

VVVVV
### The effort extra
- The more effort principle:
	- The more **effort into a commitment**, the great is its ability to influence attitude
- The hell week illustration

Notes:

VVVVV
### The inner choice
- We've seen that:
- Commitment are most effective when active, public & effortful
- Inner choice is the most important property of effective commitment
- Illustration with Chinese POW
- The hell week fraternity  illustration
- The  Freedman experimentation
Notes:
Social scientists have determined that we __accept inner responsibility for a
behavior when we think we have chosen to perform it in the absence of strong
outside pressures.__ __A large reward is one such external pressure__. It may get us to
perform a certain action, but it won’t get us to accept inner responsibility for the act.
Consequently, we won’t feel committed to it. The same is true of a strong threat; it
may motivate immediate compliance, but it is unlikely to produce long-term
commitment.

VVVVV
### vulnerability & Explanation
- Commitment with inner choice:
	- Change from inner choice is not specific to  a given situation but covers a whole range of situations
	- Its effect last longer
	- Commitment that leads to inner change grow their own legs
- The lowball principle:

Notes:
        The advantage to an unscrupulous compliance professional is tremendous.
        Because we build new struts to undergird choices we have committed ourselves to,
        an exploitative individual can offer us an inducement for making such a choice, and
        after the decision has been made, can remove that inducement, knowing that our
        decision will probably stand on its own newly created legs.

VVVVV
### The lowball principle: The car dealer illustration
- Very good price is offered  on a car (often bellow the competition)
- Getting you to make decision on purchasing the new car
	- Filling of raft of purchase
	- Extensive financing terms
	- Encouraging test driving
- Then calculation error occurs

Notes:
- The dealership   example:
- The energy saving principle

>>>>>
### HOW TO SAY NO?

- A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds
- Consistency and commitment are general good
- But automatic and unthinkable consistency may be bad

## Cognitive Dissonance

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/korGK0yGIDo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

- Leon Festinger, "A theory of cognitive dissonance" (1957)

Notes:

- It is consistency
- More specifically this is  __inner choice__
- Both lies
	- One lie for money, and stay consistent to that (sufficient amount of money)
	- Other
		- No such insentive
		- Need a reason 
		- Start to believe it to stay consistent
- But the term stands for something __more general__

- "According to cognitive dissonance theory, there is a tendency for individuals to seek consistency among their cognitions" (definition from: https://www.instructionaldesign.org/theories/cognitive-dissonance/)
 - Cognitions in video ->  "beliefs, feelings or values"

- Consistency effect presented by cialdini -> more emphasis of justifying actions
	- Such as POW camps 
	- Cialdini's term match this experiment a little better => cos no link with beliefs,feelings or values

Was known through this blog (in french) about social psychology:

Notes:
- Last example, regroup a few concept
- We might have mentionned it but not for consistency
- Focus on consistency effect
- 1:23 - 3:40 

VVVVV
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #456789" -->
### MLM: What have we learned so far?

- We buy the right to sell product for the company ("entry price")
- Since money is made by selling the right to sell to others:
	- Pyramid scheme
- Chuck Norris' face endorses it 
- In addition: people make false claims

Notes: 
- People make crazy claims, product help getting pregannt, cure cancer (in between given time)

Notes:
- 11:25 - 12:42
- 14:05 - 15:22

VVVVV
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #456789" -->
### MLM: What have we learned this time?

- Bad products
	- Need to order enough to keep advantageous price
	 - You make money from "selling the concept of selling to other people"
- People commit more and more:
	- Fill the garage 
	- But also involve their personnal life

Notes: 
- Transition on personnal life

Notes: 
- /!\ read first
- Video of Babar Lelefan 
- Satirical youtube channel/ twitter account (in french)
- Here he pretended to be interested in joining a MLM company
- Allow us to see the dynamic inside those groups
    
- 2:30 : 5 

- Analysis in next slide

VVVVV
<!-- .slide: data-background=" #456789" -->
 
### MLM: consistency and commitement 

- They sell a job and thus an entry price 
- They involves their entire social circle
	- Magic act + Public eye 
- No real gain -> Cognitive Dissonance experiment
- Advice come from a friend -> Reciprocity and Similarity effects

Notes:
- They sell work -> entry price     => which is how money is made

- They use they social network,     => try to convice their close and distant acquaintances

	- Combination of magic act and public eye      
		- =>  lead to commitement and consistency effect
		- =>  so they go deeper and deeper 
- They win almost nothing, they convince themselves like we saw in Cognitive Dissonance (inner choice)
- Advice come from a friend -> like in the Reciprocity and Similarity effects
